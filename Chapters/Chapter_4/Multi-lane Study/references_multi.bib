abstract = {This paper presents an optimization strategy to coordinate a fleet of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) traveling on ad-hoc pre-defined roadmaps. Specifically, the objective is to maximize traffic throughput of AGVs navigating in an automated warehouse by minimizing the time AGVs spend negotiating complex traffic patterns to avoid collisions with other AGVs. In this work, the coordination problem is posed as a Quadratic Program where the optimization is performed in a centralized manner. The proposed method is validated by means of simulations and experiments for different industrial warehouse scenarios. The performance of the proposed strategy is then compared with a recently proposed decentralized coordination strategy that relies on local negotiations for shared resources. The results show that the proposed coordination strategy successfully maximizes vehicle throughput and significantly minimizes the time vehicles spend negotiating traffic under different scenarios.},

abstract = {E-commerce retailers face the challenge to assemble large numbers of time-critical picking orders each consisting of just a few order lines with low order quantities. Traditional picker-to-parts warehouses are often ill-suited for these prerequisites, so that automated warehousing systems (e.g., automated picking workstations, robots, and AGV-assisted order picking systems) are applied and organizational adaptions (e.g., mixed-shelves storage, dynamic order processing, and batching, zoning and sorting systems) are made in this branch of industry. This paper is dedicated to these warehousing systems especially suited for e-commerce retailers. We discuss suited systems, survey the relevant literature, and define future research needs.},

@article{Digani2015,
abstract = {This paper deals with a holistic approach to coordinate a fleet of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) in an industrial environment. We propose an ensemble approach based on a two layer control architecture and on an automatic algorithm for the definition of the roadmap. The roadmap is built by considering the path planning algorithm implemented on the hierarchical architecture and vice versa. In this way, we want to manage the coordination of the whole system in order to increase the flexibility and the global efficiency. Furthermore, the roadmap is computed in order to maximize the redundancy, the coverage and the connectivity. The architecture is composed of two layers. The low-level represents the roadmap itself. The high-level describes the topological relationship among different areas of the environment. The path planning algorithm works on both these levels and the subsequent coordination among AGVs is obtained exploiting shared resource (i.e., centralized information) and local negotiation (i.e., decentralized coordination). The proposed approach is validated by means of simulations and comparison using real plants.},
