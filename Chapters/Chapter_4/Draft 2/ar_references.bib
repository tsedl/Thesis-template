abstract = {Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are an unmanned transport system used for the horizontal movement of materials. The dispatching and routing problem (DRP) for AGV systems involves making dispatching and routing decisions. The DRP is an important and fundamental problem in the scheduling of AGV systems, and number of studies have been conducted. However, for the application to real AGV systems, we have to consider additional constraints such as collision avoidance, the capacity of the system components, the ease of changing routes, and robustness against disturbance. This paper studies the dispatch and conflict-free routing problem of capacitated AGV systems (DCFRPC). In the DCFRPC, finite capacity for each vehicle and machine buffer is imposed, and task dispatching and conflict-free routing must be achieved. This paper formulates the DCFRPC as an integer program, and then, local/random search methods are proposed. This paper also empirically evaluates the proposed methods through computational experiments.},

abstract = {A centralized multi-AGV motion planning method is proposed. In contrast to the prevalent planners with decentralized (decoupled) formulations, a centralized planner contains no priority assignment, decoupling, or other specification strategies, thus is free from being case-dependent and deadlock-involved. Although centralized motion planning is computationally expensive, it deserves investigations in schemes that are sensitive to solution quality but insensitive to computation time. Specifically, centralized multi-AGV motion planning is formulated as an optimal control problem in this work, wherein differential algebraic equations are used to describe the AGV dynamics, mechanical restrictions, and exterior constraints. Orthogonal collocation direct transcription method is adopted to discretize the original infinite-dimensional optimal control problem into a large-scale nonlinear programming (NLP) problem, which is solved using interior point method thereafter. Exhaustive simulations are conducted on 10-AGV formation reconfiguration tasks. Simulation results show the validation, unification, and real-time implementation potential of the introduced centralized planner. Particularly, the computation time on a PC reduces to several seconds with near-optimal initial guess in the NLP solving process, making receding horizon replanning possible via this centralized planner.},

abstract = {When planning for multi-robot navigation tasks under uncertainty, plans should prevent robots from colliding while still reaching their goal. Solutions achieving this fall on a spectrum. At one end are solutions which prevent robots from being in the same part of the environment simultaneously at planning time, ignoring the robots' capabilities to manoeuvre around each other, whilst at the other end are solutions that solve the problem at execution time, relying solely on online conflict resolution. Both approaches can lead to inefficient behaviour. In this paper, we present a novel framework in the middle of this spectrum that explicitly reasons over the effect the presence of multiple robots has on navigation performance. We refer to this effect as congestion. We present a structure, called the probabilistic reservation table, which summarises the plans of robots, allowing us to probabilistically model congestion.We showhow this structure can be used for planning by proposing an approach that, for each robot, sequentially builds and solves a Markov decision process where the transition probabilities are obtained by querying the probabilistic reservation table. We carry out experiments on synthetic data and in simulation to show the effectiveness of our framework.},

abstract = {The current industrial state of the art for automated guided vehicles relies on centralised controllers dispatching transports to vehicles along predefined paths. The design of these paths is time-consuming and has to be done in advance, followed by an extensive testing phase. In the field of mobile robotics, robust path planning and navigation algorithms exist. However, they have not yet found their way into industrial applications in larger numbers. In this paper, we present a system architecture for a decentralised control of multiple automated guided vehicles performing material transportation tasks in intra-logistic applications which is based on mobile robotics solutions. The proposed system includes solutions for self-localisation, behaviour control, conflict-free routing and motion control. The non-centralised control of the system architecture allows for dynamic path planning and traffic coordination. Its implementation is based on the Robot Operating System, the de-facto standard middleware for robotics applications. We give an overview of the overall system architecture as well as the coordination mechanisms and show a first proof of concept in simulations.},

abstract = {A fundamental problem in the management of an automated guided vehicle system (AGVS) is the determination of the load to be transported and the vehicle to transport it. The time for the loading and unloading of pallets must be specified as soon as possible. Typical objectives are minimization of travel times and costs by the reduction of the number of vehicles required to fulfill a given transportation order. This article presents a methodology for the estimation the minimum number of AGVs (considering all the available ones at the shop floor level) required to execute a given transportation order within a specific time-window. A comparison is made between the algorithms Shortest Job First and meta-heuristic Tabu Search (applied to an initial solution) for a task assignment. An enhanced Dijkstra algorithm is used for the conflict-free routing task. The number of vehicles is estimated so as to provide an efficient distribution of tasks and reduce the operational costs of the materials handling system. Simulation results of two typical industrial warehouse shop floor scenarios are provided. Although the study focuses on pre-planning of order fulfillment of materials handling, the proposed methodology can also be utilized as an important tool for investment analysis of the warehouse layout design and for estimating the ideal number of AGVs.},

The initial route of each task is predetermined by improved Dijkstra's algorithm. The server detects the potential collisions by comparing each workstation's ID and corresponding time window in every route. This paper presents four collision classifications and three solutions.

AVs are requested to serve a number of workstations (WS) (following a specified desired production plan for materials requirements) while taking into account the safe movement (collisions avoidance) in the shop floor as well as time duration and energy resources. The proposed approach is based on the Bump-Surface concept to represent the 2D environment through a single mathematical entity. The solution of the combined problem of path planning and task scheduling is searched on a higher-dimension B-surface (in our case 3D) in such a way that its inverse image into the robot environment satisfies the given objectives and constraints. Then, a modified Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to search for a near-optimum solution. The objective of the fleet coordination consists of determining the best feasible paths for the AVs so that all the WS are served at the lowest possible cost. The efficiency of the developed method is investigated and discussed through characteristic simulated experiments concerning a variety of operating environments.},

We use multi-robot systems to collect and deliver those items from their location back to the station with restriction on the limit carrying capacity. The environment is a simulated warehouse consisting of markers as nodes for robots travel. Since finding the optimum solution is an NP-hard problem, the greedy method is utilized. We use the Manhattan distance to approximate the nearest item for each robot and employed Dijkstras algorithm for path planning and obstacle avoidance. Moreover, we use the local search to find nearby target items. We compare two collection strategies, namely the individual collection method that let each robot takes responsibility for its own station and the collaborative collection method that allows robots take nearest items and deliver them to all stations. The performance of both methods has been verified by the simulation using MATLAB. The collaborative collection method is able to surpass the individual collection method with up to 15.4{\%} reduction in maximum traveling cost.},

This paper describe a multi-agent approach to the operational control of AGVs by integration of path generation, enumerating time-windows, searching interruptions, adjusting waiting time and taking decisions on the selection of routes. It presents an efficient algorithm and rules for finding a conflict-free shortest-time path for AGVs, which is applicable to a bi- and unidirectional flow path network. The concept of loop formation in a flow path network is introduced to deal with the parking of idle vehicles, without obstructing the path of moveable AGVs. The concept of loop formation at nodes reduces the timing-taking task of finding the dynamic positioning of idle AGVs in the network.},

The paper presents a novel control strategy to avoid deadlock and collisions in zone-controlled AGVS. In particular, the control scheme manages the assignments of new paths to vehicles and their acquisition of the next zone. Moreover, the use of coloured Petri nets is proposed to model the dynamics of AGVS and implement the control strategy stemming from the knowledge of the system state. Additionally, extending the coloured Petri net model with a time concept allows investigation of system performance. Several simulations of an AGVS with varying fleet size while measuring appropriate performance indices show the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy compared with an alternative policy previously presented.},

Safety is guaranteed by maintaining, at each time step, a dynamically feasible trajectory for each aircraft that terminates in a loiter pattern. Conflicts between multiple aircraft are resolved in a sequential, decentralized fashion, in which each aircraft takes into account the latest trajectory and loiter pattern of the other aircraft. Besides maintaining feasibility, if the problem is too complex to be solved within the time constraints of a real- time system, this approach also provides an a priori safe rescue solution consisting of the previous trajectories and individual loiter patterns.

abstract = {This paper addresses the challenging problem of finding collision-free trajectories for many robots moving toward individual goals within a common environment. Most popular algorithms for multirobot planning manage the complexity of the problem by planning trajectories for robots individually; such decoupled methods are not guaranteed to find a solution if one exists. In contrast, this paper describes a multiphase approach to the planning problem that uses a graph and spanning tree representation to create and maintain obstacle-free paths through the environment for each robot to reach its goal. The resulting algorithm guarantees a solution for a well-defined number of robots in a common environment. The computational cost is shown to be scalable with complexity linear in the number of the robots, and demonstrated by solving the planning problem for 100 robots, simulated in an underground mine environment, in less than 1.5 s with a 1.5 GHz processor. The practicality of the algorithm is demonstrated in a real-world application requiring coordinated motion planning of multiple physical robots. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present an algorithm for decentralized control of multiple automated guided vehicles performing transportation tasks within industrial and warehousing environments. By running on each vehicle in the system, the algorithm provides vehicles with capabilities for autonomous path planning and motion co-ordination. The path planning part of the algorithm implements a free-ranging motion scheme by determining the shortest feasible paths considering nonholonomic vehicle constraints. The motion co-ordination part of the algorithm ensures safe vehicle motions by reliable detection and resolution of different conflict situations with other vehicles in the shared workspace. Conflict resolution is based on a vehicle priority scheme and results in temporary stopping or removal of the lower priority vehicles taking part in the conflict. Removal action is always performed within the vehicle's private zone, i.e., the pre-allocated local region of the workspace surrounding the vehicle. By encoding information on the vehicle size and its kinematic constraints, the introduced private zone mechanism provides the necessary physical space required for successful execution of every removal action.

@article{Dresner2008,
abstract = {Artificial intelligence research is ushering in a new era of sophisticated, mass-market transportation technology. While computers can already fly a passenger jet better than a trained human pilot, people are still faced with the dangerous yet tedious task of driving automobiles. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is the field that focuses on integrating information technology with vehicles and transportation infrastructure to make transportation safer, cheaper, and more efficient. Recent advances in ITS point to a future in which vehicles themselves handle the vast majority of the driving task. Once autonomous vehicles become popular, autonomous interactions amongst multiple vehicles will be possible. Current methods of vehicle coordination, which are all designed to work with human drivers, will be outdated. The bottleneck for roadway efficiency will no longer be the drivers, but rather the mechanism by which those drivers' actions are coordinated. While open-road driving is a well-studied and more-or-less-solved problem, urban traffic scenarios, especially intersections, are much more challenging. We believe current methods for controlling traffic, specifically at intersections, will not be able to take advantage of the increased sensitivity and precision of autonomous vehicles as compared to human drivers. In this article, we suggest an alternative mechanism for coordinating the movement of autonomous vehicles through intersections. Drivers and intersections in this mechanism are treated as autonomous agents in a multiagent system. In this multiagent system, intersections use a new reservation-based approach built around a detailed communication protocol, which we also present. We demonstrate in simulation that our new mechanism has the potential to significantly outperform current intersection control technology—traffic lights and stop signs. Because our mechanism can emulate a traffic light or stop sign, it subsumes the most popular current methods of intersection control. This article also presents two extensions to the mechanism. The first extension allows the system to control human-driven vehicles in addition to autonomous vehicles. The second gives priority to emergency vehicles without significant cost to civilian vehicles. The mechanism, including both extensions, is implemented and tested in simulation, and we present experimental results that strongly attest to the efficacy of this approach.},

@article{Bennewitz2001,
abstract = {Coordinating the motion of multiple mobile robots is one of the fundamental problems in robotics. The predominant algorithms for coordinating teams of robots are decoupled and prioritized, thereby avoiding combinatorially hard planning problems typically faced by centralized approaches. While these methods are very efficient, they have two major drawbacks. First, they are incomplete, i.e. they sometimes fail to find a solution even if one exists, and second, the resulting solutions are often not optimal. In this paper we present a method for finding and optimizing priority schemes for such prioritized and decoupled planning techniques. Existing approaches apply a single priority scheme which makes them overly prone to failure in cases where valid solutions exist. By searching in the space of priorization schemes, our approach overcomes this limitation. It performs a randomized search with hill-climbing to find solutions and to minimize the overall path length. To focus the search, our algorithm is guided by constraints generated from the task specification. To illustrate the appropriateness of this approach, this paper discusses experimental results obtained with real robots and through systematic robot simulation. The experimental results illustrate the superior performance of our approach, both in terms of efficiency of robot motion and in the ability to find valid plans.},

Results show that high-quality paths can be produced in less than a second of computation time, even in confined environments involving many robots. We examine three issues in particular in this paper: the assignment of priorities to the robots, the performance of prioritized planning versus coordinated planning, and the influence of the extent by which the robot motions are constrained on the performance of the method. Results are reported in terms of both running time and the quality of the paths produced. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel method for highly-scalable coordination of free-ranging automated guided vehicles in industrial logistics and manufacturing scenarios. The primary aim of this method is to enhance the current industrial state-of-the-art multi-vehicle transportation systems, which, despite their long presence on the factory floor and significant advances over the last decades, still rely on a centralized controller and predetermined network of paths. In order to eliminate the major drawbacks of such systems, including poor scalability, low flexibility, and the presence of a single point of failure, in the proposed control approach vehicles autonomously execute their assigned pick-up and delivery operations by running a fully decentralized control algorithm. The algorithm integrates path planning and motion coordination capabilities and relies on a two-layer control architecture with topological workspace representation on the top layer and state-lattice representation on the bottom layer. Each vehicle plans its own shortest feasible path toward the assigned goal location and resolves conflict situations with other vehicles as they arise along the way. The motion coordination strategy relies on the private-zone mechanism ensuring reliable collision avoidance, and local negotiations within the limited communication radius ensuring high scalability as the number of vehicles in the fleet increases. We present experimental validation results obtained on a system comprising six Pioneer 3DX robots in four different scenarios and simulation results with up to fifty vehicles. We also analyze the overall quality of the proposed traffic management method and compare its performance to other state-of-the-art multi-vehicle coordination approaches.},

Currently, AGVs are also used for repeating transportation tasks in other areas, such as warehouses, container terminals and external (underground) transportation systems. This paper discusses literature related to design and control issues of AGV systems at manufacturing, distribution, transshipment and transportation systems. It is concluded that most models can be applied for design problems at manufacturing centres. Some of these models and new models already proved to be successful in large AGV systems. In fact, new analytical and simulation models need to be developed for large AGV systems to overcome large computation times, NP-completeness, congestion, deadlocks and delays in the system and finite planning horizons.

abstract = {One of the challenging optimization problems is determining the minimizer of a nonlinear programming problem that has binary variables. A vexing difficulty is the rate the work to solve such problems increases as the number of discrete variables increases. Any such problem with bounded discrete variables, especially binary variables, may be transformed to that of finding a global optimum of a problem in continuous variables. However, the transformed problems usually have astronomically large numbers of local minimizers, making them harder to solve than typical global optimization problems. Despite this apparent disadvantage, we show that the approach is not futile if we use smoothing techniques. The method we advocate first convexifies the problem and then solves a sequence of subproblems, whose solutions form a trajectory that leads to the solution. To illustrate how well the algorithm performs we show the computational results of applying it to problems taken from the literature and new test problems with known optimal solutions. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

This study compared Dijkstra algorithm, A* algorithm and Floyd-Warshall algorithm in term of the time, the computational load and memory usage. OMNeT++ network simulator is used to map the vertices and edge into a collection of nodes and channels that are interconnected. Mesh topology is used in this study to represent a real network conditions. Each edge in the mesh network has a value so as to form a weighted graph. The complexity of the route will be proportional to the scale of the mesh network. Based on the simulation, the value of computational load and simulation time are proportional to the square of the number of nodes for all simulated algorithms. The results show that A* algorithm has smaller computational load and simulation time than the other algorithms without affecting the shortest route results. Dijkstra algorithm performs better in term of memory usage. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is the worst of all simulated algorithm, because all data channel weights needs to be processed using a multi level loop operation. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

The construction of the vehicle is based on a steel frame similar to the classical bicycle frame. The vehicle has been additionally equipped with pedals as an alternative driving source as well as with the standard motorcycle equipment, i.e. lamps, breaking light, horn, front disc brake, etc. The prime power source which is the BLDC motor has been installed in the rear wheel hub and is powered by a pack of 220 lithium-ion power cells of 2600 mAh each. The nominal parameters of the designed power pack is 72 V and 27.5 Ah of capacity. The motor controller which can be powered by the voltage from 36 V to 95 V can deliver up to 80 A of current. It enables regenerative braking which increases an overall range of the vehicle. The article discusses also the problem of classification of such construction according to the Polish law described in the Act on the Law of Road Traffic as well as in the Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure of 31 December 2002 on the technical conditions of vehicles and the scope of their necessary equipment. Finally, the designed construction has been tested on the MAHA LPS 3000 chassis dynamometer in order to measure mechanical and electrical parameters like maximal electric power of the motor, maximal mechanical power on the wheel, motor torque, maximal rotational speed, energy consumption, windings temperature reached, etc. These quantities will serve to further development of the designed construction.},

While operating under a budget constraint limiting the number of locations it can visit, the robot needs to decide which locations to visit, to adjust water emitters and collect soil moisture samples to improve the inference model used to estimate soil water content. This problem can be cast as an instance of multi-objective orienteering, a computationally hard problem scarcely studied in the past. Building upon the heuristic solutions we recently developed for the single objective orienteering Problem, in this paper we develop and compare various solutions for the case involving two distinct but concurrent objective functions. The goal is to develop algorithms that are both efficient and easy to tune for a non-expert human user.

The main problem with robotics software usually is that it runs on a particular platform and transferring source code to another platform is crucial. In this paper, we present our software framework Fawkes which follows the component-based software design paradigm by featuring a clear component concept with well-defined communication interfaces. We deployed Fawkes on several different robot platforms ranging from service robots to biped soccer robots. Following the component concept with clearly defined communication interfaces shows great benefit when porting robot software from one robot to the other. Fawkes comes with a number of useful plugins for tasks like timing, logging, data visualization, software configuration, and even high-level decision making. These make it particularly easy to create and to debug productive code, shortening the typical development cycle for robot software.},

While the robotics community agrees that the benchmarking is of high importance to objectively compare different solutions, there are only few and limited tools to support it. To address this issue in the context of multi-robot systems, we have defined a benchmarking process based on experimental designs, which aimed at improving the reproducibility of experiments by making explicit all elements of a benchmark such as parameters, measurements and metrics. We have also developed a ROS (Robot Operating System)-based testbed with the goal of making it easy for users to validate, benchmark, and compare different algorithms including coordination strategies. Our testbed uses the MORSE (Modular OpenRobots Simulation Engine) simulator for realistic simulation and a computer cluster for decentralized computation. In this paper, we present our testbed in details with the architecture and infrastructure, the issues encountered in implementing the infrastructure, and the automation of the deployment. We also report a series of experiments on multi-robot exploration, in order to demonstrate the capabilities of our testbed.},

abstract = {The increasing availability of multiple sets of data and the need to solve complex problems that involves different focus and wide areas allow urban and traffic planners to choose from a variety of different modelling tools, ranging from transport modelling suites to standalone simulation models. Each of them is highly specialised but works independently with a considerable increase of running time when large scenarios are simulated. This issue could be overcome by looking at the integration of different tools as well as the ability to simulate large scenarios in less time. While some existing software packages provide some of the means of integration, this is usually a bespoke integration with another package, which limits the interoperability with diverse tools and models. Also, so far no one has attempted to run in an integrated way several micro-simulators for a unique larger area simulation. This is because the integration and redistribution over several simulators is a major issue. In this paper we present an architecture and methodology to distribute simulations across several simulators to address this issue, which can be used to simulate large scale urban scenarios.},

abstract = {The MATSim (Multi-Agent Transport Simulation) software project was started around 2006 with the goal of generating traffic and congestion patterns by following individual synthetic travelers through their daily or weekly activity programme. It has since then evolved from a collection of stand-alone C++ programs to an integrated Java-based framework which is publicly hosted, open-source available, automatically regression tested. It is currently used by about 40 groups throughout the world. This book takes stock of the current status. The first part of the book gives an introduction to the most important concepts, with the intention of enabling a potential user to set up and run basic simulations.The second part of the book describes how the basic functionality can be extended, for example by adding schedule-based public transit, electric or autonomous cars, paratransit, or within-day replanning. For each extension, the text provides pointers to the additional documentation and to the code base. It is also discussed how people with appropriate Java programming skills can write their own extensions, and plug them into the MATSim core. The project has started from the basic idea that traffic is a consequence of human behavior, and thus humans and their behavior should be the starting point of all modelling, and with the intuition that when simulations with 100 million particles are possible in computational physics, then behavior-oriented simulations with 10 million travelers should be possible in travel behavior research. The initial implementations thus combined concepts from computational physics and complex adaptive systems with concepts from travel behavior research. The third part of the book looks at theoretical concepts that are able to describe important aspects of the simulation system; for example, under certain conditions the code becomes a Monte Carlo engine sampling from a discrete choice model. Another important aspect is the interpretation of the MATSim score as utility in the microeconomic sense, opening up a connection to benefit cost analysis. Finally, the book collects use cases as they have been undertaken with MATSim. All current users of MATSim were invited to submit their work, and many followed with sometimes crisp and short and sometimes longer contributions, always with pointers to additional references. We hope that the book will become an invitation to explore, to build and to extend agent-based modeling of travel behavior from the stable and well tested core of MATSim documented here.},

Stakeholders of particular modes, tourists and commuters, old and young have their own needs and ideas and they all demand to be involved in the planning process of transport projects without having to dig into the words and numbers produced by traffic engineers. Microsimulation is a tool which accommodates both: the requirements that are set by the complexity of such projects, as well as the needs to produce easy-to-understand information and communication material. This paper demonstrates the capability of microsimulation through a French case study, including the planning and design of transport schemes for a busy city centre and urban area where all modes of transport are being used and there is a strong focus of public attention.

abstract = {Stage is a C++ software library that simulates multiple mobile robots. Stage version 2, as the simulation backend for the Player/Stage system, may be the most commonly used robot simulator in research and university teaching today. Development of Stage version 3 has focused on improving scalability, usability, and portability. This paper examines Stage's scalability. We propose a simple benchmark for multi-robot simulator performance, and present results for Stage. Run time is shown to scale approximately linearly with population size up to 100,000 robots. For example, Stage simulates 1 simple robot at around 1,000 times faster than real time, and 1,000 simple robots at around real time. These results suggest that Stage may be useful for swarm robotics researchers who would otherwise use custom simulators, with their attendant disadvantages in terms of code reuse and transparency. {\textcopyright} Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2008.},

@article{Rivera2019,
abstract = {The fusion of different technologies is the base of the fourth industrial revolution. Companies are encouraged to integrate new tools in their production processes in order to improve working conditions and increase productivity and production quality. The integration between information, communication technologies and industrial automation can create highly flexible production models for products and services that can be customized through real-time interactions between consumer, production and machinery throughout the production process. The future of production, therefore, depends on increasingly intelligent machinery through the use of digital systems. The key elements for future integrated devices are intelligent systems and machines, based on human-machine interaction and information sharing. To do so, the implementation of shared languages that allow different systems to dialogue in a simple way is necessary. In this perspective, the use of advanced prototyping tools like Open-Source programming systems, the development of more detailed multibody models through the use of CAD software and the use of self-learning techniques will allow for developing a new class of machines capable of revolutionizing our companies. The purpose of this paper is to present a waypoint navigation activity of a custom Wheeled Mobile Robot (WMR) in an available simulated 3D indoor environment by using the Gazebo simulator. Gazebo was developed in 2002 at the University of Southern California. The idea was to create a high-fidelity simulator that gave the possibility to simulate robots in outdoor environments under various conditions. In particular, we wanted to test the high-performance physics Open Dynamics Engine (ODE) and the sensors feature present in Gazebo for prototype development activities. This choice was made for the possibility of emulating not only the system under analysis, but also the world in which the robot will operate. Furthermore, the integration tools available with Solidworks and Matlab-Simulink, well known commercial platforms of modelling and robotics control respectively, are also explored.},

Development and control of such systems differs from traditional automation methods and consequently leads to new challenges. Thankfully, Robot Operating System (ROS) provides a communication platform and a vast variety of tools and utilities that can aid that development. However, it is hard to use ROS in large-scale automation systems due to communication issues in a distributed setup, hence the development of ROS2.

@article{Cardarelli2017,
abstract = {In this paper we introduce a novel cloud robotics architecture that provides different functionalities to support enhanced coordination of groups of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) used for industrial logistics. In particular, we define a cooperative data fusion system that, gathering data from different sensing sources, provides a constantly updated global live view of the industrial environment, for coordinating the motion of the AGVs in an optimized manner. In fact, local sensing capabilities are complemented with global information, thus extending the field of view of each AGV. This knowledge extension allows to support a cooperative and flexible global route assignment and local path planning in order to avoid congestion zones, obstacles reported in the global live view map and deal with unexpected obstacles in the current path. The proposed methodology is validated in a real industrial environment, allowing an AGV to safely perform an obstacle avoidance procedure.},

abstract = {With the rapid development and application of vehicle communication technology and autonomous driving technology, the traffic flow of freeways and urban roads will inevitably change from traditional traffic flow (all vehicles are controlled by human drivers) to heterogeneous traffic flow (including CACC and other autonomous vehicles). At present, in the field of heterogeneous traffic flow, scholars mostly take modeling and simulation as the means to study the impact of heterogeneous flow in the freeway scene, but few studies discuss the impact of heterogeneous traffic flow on urban roads, especially in the scene of signal control area. In view of this, taking the IDM model as the traditional traffic flow model and the ACC model proposed by University of California at Berkeley as an automatic driving model, this paper builds a heterogeneous traffic flow model in the vicinity of intersections at the background of typical urban traffic scene and also preliminary explore the influence mechanism of the mix of autopilot on the traffic flow in the signal control area through simulation experiments , which can provide reference for the development and application of automatic driving technology.},

@article{Baz2020,
abstract = {The rapidly improving autonomous vehicle (AV) technology will have a significant impact on traffic safety and efficiency. This study introduces a game-theory-based priority control algorithm for autonomous vehicles to improve intersection safety and efficiency with mixed traffic. By using vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, this model allows an AV to exchange information with the roadside units (RSU) to support the decision making of whether an ordinary vehicle (OV) or an AV should pass the intersection first. The safety of vehicles is taken in different stages of decisions to assure collision-free intersection operations. Two different mathematical models have been developed, where model one is for an AV/AV situation and model two is when an AV meets an OV. A simulation model was developed to implement the algorithm and compare the performance of each model with the conventional traffic control at a four-legged signalized intersection and at a roundabout. Three levels of traffic volume and speed combinations were tested in the simulation. The results show significant reductions in delay for both cases; for case (I), AV/AV model, a 65{\%} reduction compared to a roundabout and 84{\%} compared to a four-legged signalized intersection, and for case (II), AV/OV model, the reduction is 30{\%} and 89{\%}, respectively.},

abstract = {We consider the Generalized Trust Region Subproblem (GTRS) of minimizing a nonconvex quadratic objective over a nonconvex quadratic constraint. A lifting of this problem recasts the GTRS as minimizing a linear objective subject to two nonconvex quadratic constraints. Our first main contribution is structural: we give an explicit description of the convex hull of this nonconvex set in terms of the generalized eigenvalues of an associated matrix pencil. This result may be of interest in building relaxations for nonconvex quadratic programs. Moreover, this result allows us to reformulate the GTRS as the minimization of two convex quadratic functions in the original space. Our next set of contributions is algorithmic: we present an algorithm for solving the GTRS up to an epsilon additive error based on this reformulation. We carefully handle numerical issues that arise from inexact generalized eigenvalue and eigenvector computations and establish explicit running time guarantees for these algorithms. Notably, our algorithms run in linear (in the size of the input) time. Furthermore, our algorithm for computing an epsilon-optimal solution has a slightly-improved running time dependence on epsilon over the state-of-the-art algorithm. Our analysis shows that the dominant cost in solving the GTRS lies in solving a generalized eigenvalue problem -- establishing a natural connection between these problems. Finally, generalizations of our convex hull results allow us to apply our algorithms and their theoretical guarantees directly to equality-, interval-, and hollow- constrained variants of the GTRS. This gives the first linear-time algorithm in the literature for these variants of the GTRS.},

abstract = {Intersection management is one of the most challenging problems within the transport system. Traffic light-based methods have been efficient but are not able to deal with the growing mobility and social challenges. On the other hand, the advancements of automation and communications have enabled cooperative intersection management, where road users, infrastructure, and traffic control centers are able to communicate and coordinate the traffic safely and efficiently. Major techniques and solutions for cooperative intersections are surveyed in this paper for both signalized and nonsignalized intersections, whereas focuses are put on the latter. Cooperative methods, including time slots and space reservation, trajectory planning, and virtual traffic lights, are discussed in detail. Vehicle collision warning and avoidance methods are discussed to deal with uncertainties. Concerning vulnerable road users, pedestrian collision avoidance methods are discussed. In addition, an introduction to major projects related to cooperative intersection management is presented. A further discussion of the presented works is given with highlights of future research topics. This paper serves as a comprehensive survey of the field, aiming at stimulating new methods and accelerating the advancement of automated and cooperative intersections.},

Previous efforts on autonomous intersection control (AIC) mainly focused on collisions avoid- ance and traffic efficiency, without considering travel experience from passengers' perspective. In this work, we design a convex optimization based AIC mechanism. In particular, we design the metric of smoothness with the objective of quantitatively capturing the quality of travel experience and transform the objective into a convex function. In addition, we linearize colli- sion avoidance constraints by designing a schedule rule, which determines the priority of vehicles when passing through the intersection according to the travel time of individual vehicles. On this basis, we propose a new algorithm to achieve the optimal solution with low overhead. Finally, we build the simulation model and implement the algorithm for performance evaluation. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm.},

@article{Levin2017,
abstract = {Reservation-based intersection controls, in which vehicles reserve space-time paths through the intersection, have the potential to make greater use of intersection capacity than traffic signals. However, the efficiency of previous microsimulations of reservations has been severely limited by a protocol that requires vehicles to request reservations and the intersection manager to accept or reject them. We propose a new protocol, AIM∗, in which the intersection manager assigns reservations to vehicles, to greatly increase the optimization possibilities. Then, we present a mixed integer linear program for optimally choosing vehicle reservations under AIM∗. The formulation is similar to conflict resolution models for aviation, and ensures separation at all points that vehicles might intersect. We therefore present a rolling-horizon algorithm to extend the method to larger numbers of vehicles. Results show that the optimal reservation assignments from AIM∗ significantly reduce delays over previous protocols. Furthermore, the rolling horizon solutions have similar delays to a fixed horizon, thereby providing an efficient method of implementing AIM∗.},

abstract = {Reservation-based intersection control is a revolutionary idea for using connected autonomous vehicle technologies to improve intersection controls. Vehicles individually request permission to follow precise paths through the intersection at specific times from an intersection manager agent. Previous studies have shown that reservations can reduce delays beyond optimized signals in many demand scenarios. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that signals can outperform reservations through theoretical and realistic examples. We present two examples that exploit the reservation protocol to prioritize vehicles on local roads over vehicles on arterials, increasing the total vehicle delay. A third theoretical example demonstrates that reservations can encourage selfish route choice leading to arbitrarily large queues. Next, we present two realistic networks taken from metropolitan planning organization data in which reservations perform worse than signals. We conclude with significantly positive results from comparing reservations and signals on the downtown Austin grid network using dynamic traffic assignment. Overall, these results indicate that network-based analyses are needed to detect adverse route choices before traffic signals can be replaced with reservation controls. In asymmetric intersections (e.g. local road-arterial intersections), reservation controls can cause several potential issues. However, in networks with more symmetric intersections such as a downtown grid, reservations have great potential to improve traffic.},
