abstract = {This work presents a novel virtual vehicle based decentralized coordination framework for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). We explore the idea of CAVs being capable of positioning virtual vehicles to share their intended maneuver as well as request cooperation. This framework has potential to inspire versatile solutions and provides an intuitive interface to interact with reactive and unconnected vehicles. In this context, a preliminary coordination policy is proposed and tested on a three-legged single-lane roundabout. Simulation results show that the presented solution performs outstandingly better when it leverages the freedom at positioning virtual vehicles that our framework provides. Furthermore, the performance degradation resulting from mixing CAVs and unconnected cars is observed, and coordination assessment under this circumstance is discussed. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE. This article presents a distributed reactivepredictive scheme to coordinate autonomous vehicles at single lane roundabouts relying on shared information. Combining predictive and reactive control schemes allows dealing with potentially inconsistent priorities and behavioral uncertainties. A novel priority framework is addressed to allow vehicles to calculate relative priorities in a distributed way. The strategy is tested on simulation considering the coexistence of heterogeneous vehicles and observing the influence of traffic density on coordination performance.},

@article{Zhao2018,
abstract = {Connectivity and automation in vehicles provide the most intriguing opportunity for enabling users to better monitor transportation network conditions and make better operating decisions to improve safety and reduce pollution, energy consumption, and travel delays. This paper investigates the implications of optimally coordinating vehicles that are wirelessly connected to each other in roundabouts to achieve a smooth traffic flow. We apply an optimization framework and an analytical solution that allows optimal coordination of vehicles for merging in such traffic scenario. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through simulation and it is shown that fully coordinated vehicles reduce total travel time by 51{\%} and fuel consumption by 35{\%}. Furthermore, we study the influence of vehicle coordination in a mixed-traffic environment and compare the network performance under different market penetration rates of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). For this particular study with near-capacity demand, high penetration of CAVs is necessary to ensure an efficient and effective control, due to extremely unstable traffic.},

@article{Jian-an2001,
abstract = {In a junction design we often face with the choice between a roundabout design and a signalised junction design. To make the choice, one important question should be answered is which design gives a higher capacity. Until now, there is few researches who clearly answer this question. Therefore a research about the detailed comparison of capacity of these two types of junction designs is needed. This paper try to compare the capacity of roundabout and signalised junction designs for junctions with four branches. In order to compare the capacities of roundabouts and signal intersections, a concept of full c pacity has been introduced both for the roundabouts and signalised junctions. The formulas for calculating the full capacity of a roundabout and a signalised junctions have been developed. It has been found that for a given geometric design, the full capacity of roundabouts depends hea ily on the O-D traffic flow distribution at intersection, and the more vehicles turning left, the lower the full capacity of roundabouts. The comparisons between the roundabout design and the signalised intersection design for a single lane (entry/exit) junction and multi-lanes junctions are made and some interesting results are obtained. Further researches are also suggested .},

@article{Rastelli2015,
abstract = {The expansion of roads and the development of new road infrastructures have increased in recent years, linked to the population growing in large cities. In the last two decades, roundabouts have largely replaced traditional intersections in many countries. They have the advantage of allowing drivers continuous flow when traffic is clear, without the usual delay caused by traffic lights. Although roundabouts with and without traffic-signal control have been widely used and considered in the literature, driverless control on roundabouts has not been studied in depth yet. The behavior of autonomous vehicles in roundabouts can be divided into three stages: entrance, inside, and exit. The first and last may be handled as an extension of intersections. However, autonomous driving on the roundabout requires special attention. In this paper, the design and implementation of a fuzzy logic system for the steering control of autonomous vehicles inside the roundabout is proposed. Cascade architecture for lateral control and parametric trajectory generation are used. Fuzzy control has proved to be easy to define using expert knowledge. Experiments with a real prototype have been carried out, taking into account different speed profiles and lane change maneuvers inside the roundabout, with very satisfactory results.},

@article{Liu2018,
abstract = {This paper proposes a novel communication-enabled distributed conflict resolution mechanism in order for a group of connected autonomous vehicles to navigate safely and efficiently in intersections without any traffic manager. The conflict resolution strategy for individual vehicle is decoupled temporally. In a decision maker, the vehicle computes the desired time slots to pass the conflict zones by solving a conflict graph locally based on the broadcasted information from other vehicles. In a motion planner, the vehicle computes the desired speed profile by solving a temporal optimization problem constrained in the desired time slot. The estimated time to occupy the conflict zones given the new speed profile is then broadcasted again. It is proved that the aggregation of these local decisions solves the conflicts globally. Theoretically, this method provides an efficient parallel mechanism to obtain local optimal solutions of a large-scale optimization problem (e.g., multivehicle navigation). Application-wise, as demonstrated by extensive simulation, this mechanism increases the efficiency of autonomous vehicles in terms of smaller delay time, as well as the efficiency of the traffic in terms of larger throughput when there is no traffic manager to mediate the conflicts.},

@article{Lu2013,
abstract = {Traffic movement conflict points at intersections are the points at which traffic movements intersect (includ- ing crossing, merging, and diverging). Numbers and distribution of different types of conflict points are used to evaluate intersection access management designs and safety performance. Traditionally, the determina- tion of the numbers of conflict points for different traffic movements is based on manual methods, which causes the difficulty for computerized procedures to evaluate safety performance of different access man- agement designs. Sometimes, a programmable calculation procedure may provide more effective solutions as compared with manual methods. This paper presents a programmable calculation procedure for the deter- mination of the numbers of conflict points, which could be used as a basis for a computerized procedure. Concepts of virtual movement lanes and intersection quadrants are introduced to specify types of intersec- tions, traffic lane configurations, and traffic movement regulations. Calculation models, based on such con- cepts, for traffic movement conflict points at signalized and unsignalized intersections can be obtained. In support of the procedure, case studies are presented in the paper. The procedure presented in the paper can be programmed into a computer program for the purpose of a computerized evaluation of intersection safety and design performance of different access management or control approaches.},
