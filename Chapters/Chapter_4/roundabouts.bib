abstract = {Advances in autonomous and connected vehicles bring new opportunities for intelligent intersection control strategies. In this paper, we propose a centralised way to jointly integrate an intersection control problem with vehicle trajectory planning. It is formulated as a bilevel optimisation problem in which the upper level is designed to minimise the total travel time by a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. In contrast, the lower level is a linear programming (LP) model with an objective function to maximise the total speed entering the intersection. The two levels are coupled by the arrival time and terminal speed. By using the relationship between the safe time headway and the process time, a novel platoon-based method is developed to reduce the computational burden. Finally, simulation tests are carried out to investigate the control performance under different demands, intersection lengths, communication ranges and traffic compositions.},

abstract = {Connectivity and automation in vehicles provide the most intriguing opportunity for enabling users to better monitor transportation network conditions and make better operating decisions to improve safety and reduce pollution, energy consumption, and travel delays. This paper investigates the implications of optimally coordinating vehicles that are wirelessly connected to each other in roundabouts to achieve a smooth traffic flow. We apply an optimization framework and an analytical solution that allows optimal coordination of vehicles for merging in such traffic scenario. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through simulation and it is shown that fully coordinated vehicles reduce total travel time by 51{\%} and fuel consumption by 35{\%}. Furthermore, we study the influence of vehicle coordination in a mixed-traffic environment and compare the network performance under different market penetration rates of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). For this particular study with near-capacity demand, high penetration of CAVs is necessary to ensure an efficient and effective control, due to extremely unstable traffic.},

We explore the idea of CAVs being capable of positioning virtual vehicles to share their intended maneuver as well as request cooperation. This framework has potential to inspire versatile solutions and provides an intuitive interface to interact with reactive and unconnected vehicles. In this context, a preliminary coordination policy is proposed and tested on a three-legged single-lane roundabout. Simulation results show that the presented solution performs outstandingly better when it leverages the freedom at positioning virtual vehicles that our framework provides.

abstract = {In a junction design we often face with the choice between a roundabout design and a signalised junction design. To make the choice, one important question should be answered is which design gives a higher capacity. Until now, there is few researches who clearly answer this question. Therefore a research about the detailed comparison of capacity of these two types of junction designs is needed. This paper try to compare the capacity of roundabout and signalised junction designs for junctions with four branches. In order to compare the capacities of roundabouts and signal intersections, a concept of full c pacity has been introduced both for the roundabouts and signalised junctions. The formulas for calculating the full capacity of a roundabout and a signalised junctions have been developed. It has been found that for a given geometric design, the full capacity of roundabouts depends hea ily on the O-D traffic flow distribution at intersection, and the more vehicles turning left, the lower the full capacity of roundabouts. The comparisons between the roundabout design and the signalised intersection design for a single lane (entry/exit) junction and multi-lanes junctions are made and some interesting results are obtained. Further researches are also suggested .},

@article{Rastelli2015,
abstract = {The expansion of roads and the development of new road infrastructures have increased in recent years, linked to the population growing in large cities. In the last two decades, roundabouts have largely replaced traditional intersections in many countries. They have the advantage of allowing drivers continuous flow when traffic is clear, without the usual delay caused by traffic lights. Although roundabouts with and without traffic-signal control have been widely used and considered in the literature, driverless control on roundabouts has not been studied in depth yet. The behavior of autonomous vehicles in roundabouts can be divided into three stages: entrance, inside, and exit. The first and last may be handled as an extension of intersections. However, autonomous driving on the roundabout requires special attention. In this paper, the design and implementation of a fuzzy logic system for the steering control of autonomous vehicles inside the roundabout is proposed. Cascade architecture for lateral control and parametric trajectory generation are used. Fuzzy control has proved to be easy to define using expert knowledge. Experiments with a real prototype have been carried out, taking into account different speed profiles and lane change maneuvers inside the roundabout, with very satisfactory results.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel communication-enabled distributed conflict resolution mechanism in order for a group of connected autonomous vehicles to navigate safely and efficiently in intersections without any traffic manager. The conflict resolution strategy for individual vehicle is decoupled temporally. In a decision maker, the vehicle computes the desired time slots to pass the conflict zones by solving a conflict graph locally based on the broadcasted information from other vehicles. In a motion planner, the vehicle computes the desired speed profile by solving a temporal optimization problem constrained in the desired time slot. The estimated time to occupy the conflict zones given the new speed profile is then broadcasted again. It is proved that the aggregation of these local decisions solves the conflicts globally. Theoretically, this method provides an efficient parallel mechanism to obtain local optimal solutions of a large-scale optimization problem (e.g., multivehicle navigation). Application-wise, as demonstrated by extensive simulation, this mechanism increases the efficiency of autonomous vehicles in terms of smaller delay time, as well as the efficiency of the traffic in terms of larger throughput when there is no traffic manager to mediate the conflicts.},

abstract = {Traffic movement conflict points at intersections are the points at which traffic movements intersect (includ- ing crossing, merging, and diverging). Numbers and distribution of different types of conflict points are used to evaluate intersection access management designs and safety performance. Traditionally, the determina- tion of the numbers of conflict points for different traffic movements is based on manual methods, which causes the difficulty for computerized procedures to evaluate safety performance of different access man- agement designs. Sometimes, a programmable calculation procedure may provide more effective solutions as compared with manual methods. This paper presents a programmable calculation procedure for the deter- mination of the numbers of conflict points, which could be used as a basis for a computerized procedure. Concepts of virtual movement lanes and intersection quadrants are introduced to specify types of intersec- tions, traffic lane configurations, and traffic movement regulations. Calculation models, based on such con- cepts, for traffic movement conflict points at signalized and unsignalized intersections can be obtained. In support of the procedure, case studies are presented in the paper. The procedure presented in the paper can be programmed into a computer program for the purpose of a computerized evaluation of intersection safety and design performance of different access management or control approaches.},

abstract = {The present study proposes a simulation-based model of high degree flexible routing to prevent collisions and deadlocks in flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs). High degree flexible routing concurrently involves classical routing strategies (specifies the destination and static/dynamic routing between origin and destination) with routing flexibility (considers alternatives to select as destination). A new approach named Tandem-Queue-Link with a look-ahead (TQL-A) is proposed in which the look-ahead mechanism supports deadlock prevention. The TQL-A performs a collision-free status for automated guided vehicles (AGVs) routing with flexible dynamic strategy. The main contribution of the present study is to implement the routing flexible levels (RFLs) by dynamic flexible routing (DFR) as a high degree flexible routing strategy. The most efficient parameters of this highly complex FMS are designed using a multi-objective nonlinear programming model extracted from simulation metamodels based on different hypotheses. Results support some of the considered hypotheses and show the complicated relationship between different values of FMS design parameters and different levels of routing flexibility. Metamodel validity through a typical case study defines that the higher values of velocity and acceleration/deceleration can compensate the level of routing flexibility but other parameters that are influenced by the active parameter (i.e. those related to loading/unloading time) have not any sensible influence on the output.},

Their advanced hardware and control software allow autonomous operations in dynamic environments. Compared to an automated guided vehicle (AGV) system in which a central unit takes control of scheduling, routing, and dispatching decisions for all AGVs, AMRs can communicate and negotiate independently with other resources like machines and systems and thus decentralize the decision-making process. Decentralized decision-making allows the system to react dynamically to changes in the system state and environment. These developments have influenced the traditional methods and decision-making processes for planning and control. This study identifies and classifies research related to the planning and control of AMRs in intralogistics. We provide an extended literature review that highlights how AMR technological advances affect planning and control decisions. We contribute to the literature by introducing an AMR planning and control framework to guide managers in the decision-making process, thereby supporting them to achieve optimal performance. Finally, we propose an agenda for future research within this field.},

Nevertheless, they are currently no standards, which provide safety regulation in these environments for autonomous mobile robots. In this paper, three different safety concepts for mobile robots will be discussed, whereby the safe usage of a mobile robot in an industrial setting should be ensured. The first concept contains a safety ring, which allows the mobile robot to use probabilistic robotics in combination with a robust obstacle avoidance and safe hazard detection. Further, the second concept treats safe navigation without probabilistic robotics. The priority hereby lies on the self-localisation with reliable sensor methods. And in the third concept, an aware environment with object detection and tracking is shown. Virtual sensors in form of wireless sensor networks placed in the factory replace the need of physical sensors on mobile robots. The outline of this work is a theoretical comparison of these three safety concepts in consideration of their specific properties and their recommended usage for different scenarios.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a hybrid agent-based approach for the scheduling and synchronization of e-commerce logistics parks (EcLP). This is accomplished by integrating intelligent distribution centers within the e-commerce environment. The proposed platform has been developed based on an agent technology, which not only serves for decentralization and synchronization purposes but also it has been optimized for the transportation and logistics of the overall system. Moreover, mobile agent-based communication mechanisms between the hardware agents and the software agents were developed, and the proposed hybrid agent-based platform was implemented and tested based on a case study. Following this, the results were compared to a conventional system based on four main indicators.},

@article{Qi2018,
abstract = {An automated guided vehicle system (AGVS) is an advanced material handling system widely used in various automated systems, particularly in e-commerce warehouses. The warehouse operation performance, mainly focusing on transportation efficiency, is affected by many factors, such as traffic-control policies and warehouse layouts. Based on the digraph theory and real-time control, two effective traffic-control policies with polynomial-time complexity are proposed to avoid the collision and to solve deadlocks. To accommodate more complicated situations, different types of warehouse layouts are tested. Extensive simulations are carried out to study the effects of policies, warehouse layouts, task densities and timing of an AGV to apply for a resource on the evaluation of the AGVS-based warehouse operation performance, which provide guidelines for warehouse designers.},

abstract = {Industry 4.0 is the next step for the manufacturing industry by adding internet technologies to optimized automation system. This paper demonstrates automated guided vehicles (AGVs) in a real factory scenario which utilized radio frequency identification (RFID) tags for identification and motion control purposes. The AGVs were tested in a real factory scenario, focusing mainly on two types of AGVs, Karl and Jimmy. They were equipped with RFID readers to detect tags placed on the ground or inside objects. The internal logistics of a smart factory's manufacturing environment were demonstrated using the two types of AGVs. It highlighted three aspects which are seldom talked about in order to effectively implement a smart AGV system: reconfigurability, flexibility, and customizability.},

@article{Azadeh2019,
abstract = {Robotic handling systems are increasingly applied in distribution centers. The require little space, provide flexibility in managing varying demand requirements, and are able to work 24/7. This makes them particularly fit for e-commerce operations. This paper reviews new categories of automated and robotic handling systems, such as shuttle-based storage and retrieval systems, shuttle-based compact storage systems, and robotic mobile fulfillment systems. For each system, we categorize the literature in three groups: system analysis, design optimization, and operations planning and control. Our focus is to identify the research issue and operations research modeling methodology adopted to analyze the problem. We find that many new robotic systems and applications have hardly been studied in academic literature, despite their increasing use in practice. Because of unique system features (such as autonomous control, flexible layout, networked and dynamic operation), new models and methods are needed to address the design and operational control challenges for such systems, in particular, for the integration of subsystems. Integrated robotic warehouse systems will form the next category of warehouses. All vital warehouse design, planning, and control logic, such as methods to design layout, storage and order-picking system selection, storage slotting, order batching, picker routing, and picker to order assignment, will have to be revisited for new robotized warehouses.},

abstract = {Traffic congestion is one of the leading causes of lost productivity and decreased standard of living in urban settings. Recent advances in artificial intelligence suggest vehicle navigation by autonomous agents will be possible in the near future. In this paper, we propose a reservation-based system for alleviating traffic congestion, specifically at intersections, and under the assumption that the cars are controlled by agents. First, we describe a custom simulator that we have created to measure the different delays associated with conducting traffic through an intersection. Second, we specify a precise metric for evaluating the quality of traffic control at an intersection. Using this simulator and this metric, we show that our reservation-based system can perform two to three hundred times better than traffic lights. As a result, it can smoothly handle much heavier traffic conditions. We show that our system very closely approximates an overpass, which is the optimal solution for the problem with which we are dealing.},

This paper is dedicated to these warehousing systems especially suited for e-commerce retailers. We discuss suited systems, survey the relevant literature, and define future research needs.},
