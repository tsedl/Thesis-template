abstract = {Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are an unmanned transport system used for the horizontal movement of materials. The dispatching and routing problem (DRP) for AGV systems involves making dispatching and routing decisions. The DRP is an important and fundamental problem in the scheduling of AGV systems, and number of studies have been conducted. However, for the application to real AGV systems, we have to consider additional constraints such as collision avoidance, the capacity of the system components, the ease of changing routes, and robustness against disturbance. This paper studies the dispatch and conflict-free routing problem of capacitated AGV systems (DCFRPC). In the DCFRPC, finite capacity for each vehicle and machine buffer is imposed, and task dispatching and conflict-free routing must be achieved. This paper formulates the DCFRPC as an integer program, and then, local/random search methods are proposed. This paper also empirically evaluates the proposed methods through computational experiments.},

abstract = {A centralized multi-AGV motion planning method is proposed. In contrast to the prevalent planners with decentralized (decoupled) formulations, a centralized planner contains no priority assignment, decoupling, or other specification strategies, thus is free from being case-dependent and deadlock-involved. Although centralized motion planning is computationally expensive, it deserves investigations in schemes that are sensitive to solution quality but insensitive to computation time. Specifically, centralized multi-AGV motion planning is formulated as an optimal control problem in this work, wherein differential algebraic equations are used to describe the AGV dynamics, mechanical restrictions, and exterior constraints. Orthogonal collocation direct transcription method is adopted to discretize the original infinite-dimensional optimal control problem into a large-scale nonlinear programming (NLP) problem, which is solved using interior point method thereafter. Exhaustive simulations are conducted on 10-AGV formation reconfiguration tasks. Simulation results show the validation, unification, and real-time implementation potential of the introduced centralized planner. Particularly, the computation time on a PC reduces to several seconds with near-optimal initial guess in the NLP solving process, making receding horizon replanning possible via this centralized planner.},

abstract = {When planning for multi-robot navigation tasks under uncertainty, plans should prevent robots from colliding while still reaching their goal. Solutions achieving this fall on a spectrum. At one end are solutions which prevent robots from being in the same part of the environment simultaneously at planning time, ignoring the robots' capabilities to manoeuvre around each other, whilst at the other end are solutions that solve the problem at execution time, relying solely on online conflict resolution. Both approaches can lead to inefficient behaviour. In this paper, we present a novel framework in the middle of this spectrum that explicitly reasons over the effect the presence of multiple robots has on navigation performance. We refer to this effect as congestion. We present a structure, called the probabilistic reservation table, which summarises the plans of robots, allowing us to probabilistically model congestion.We showhow this structure can be used for planning by proposing an approach that, for each robot, sequentially builds and solves a Markov decision process where the transition probabilities are obtained by querying the probabilistic reservation table. We carry out experiments on synthetic data and in simulation to show the effectiveness of our framework.},

abstract = {The current industrial state of the art for automated guided vehicles relies on centralised controllers dispatching transports to vehicles along predefined paths. The design of these paths is time-consuming and has to be done in advance, followed by an extensive testing phase. In the field of mobile robotics, robust path planning and navigation algorithms exist. However, they have not yet found their way into industrial applications in larger numbers. In this paper, we present a system architecture for a decentralised control of multiple automated guided vehicles performing material transportation tasks in intra-logistic applications which is based on mobile robotics solutions. The proposed system includes solutions for self-localisation, behaviour control, conflict-free routing and motion control. The non-centralised control of the system architecture allows for dynamic path planning and traffic coordination. Its implementation is based on the Robot Operating System, the de-facto standard middleware for robotics applications. We give an overview of the overall system architecture as well as the coordination mechanisms and show a first proof of concept in simulations.},

The time for the loading and unloading of pallets must be specified as soon as possible. Typical objectives are minimization of travel times and costs by the reduction of the number of vehicles required to fulfill a given transportation order. This article presents a methodology for the estimation the minimum number of AGVs (considering all the available ones at the shop floor level) required to execute a given transportation order within a specific time-window. A comparison is made between the algorithms Shortest Job First and meta-heuristic Tabu Search (applied to an initial solution) for a task assignment. An enhanced Dijkstra algorithm is used for the conflict-free routing task. The number of vehicles is estimated so as to provide an efficient distribution of tasks and reduce the operational costs of the materials handling system. Simulation results of two typical industrial warehouse shop floor scenarios are provided. Although the study focuses on pre-planning of order fulfillment of materials handling, the proposed methodology can also be utilized as an important tool for investment analysis of the warehouse layout design and for estimating the ideal number of AGVs.},

The initial route of each task is predetermined by improved Dijkstra's algorithm. The server detects the potential collisions by comparing each workstation's ID and corresponding time window in every route. This paper presents four collision classifications and three solutions.

AVs are requested to serve a number of workstations (WS) (following a specified desired production plan for materials requirements) while taking into account the safe movement (collisions avoidance) in the shop floor as well as time duration and energy resources. The proposed approach is based on the Bump-Surface concept to represent the 2D environment through a single mathematical entity. The solution of the combined problem of path planning and task scheduling is searched on a higher-dimension B-surface (in our case 3D) in such a way that its inverse image into the robot environment satisfies the given objectives and constraints. Then, a modified Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to search for a near-optimum solution. The objective of the fleet coordination consists of determining the best feasible paths for the AVs so that all the WS are served at the lowest possible cost. The efficiency of the developed method is investigated and discussed through characteristic simulated experiments concerning a variety of operating environments.},

We use multi-robot systems to collect and deliver those items from their location back to the station with restriction on the limit carrying capacity. The environment is a simulated warehouse consisting of markers as nodes for robots travel. Since finding the optimum solution is an NP-hard problem, the greedy method is utilized. We use the Manhattan distance to approximate the nearest item for each robot and employed Dijkstras algorithm for path planning and obstacle avoidance. Moreover, we use the local search to find nearby target items. We compare two collection strategies, namely the individual collection method that let each robot takes responsibility for its own station and the collaborative collection method that allows robots take nearest items and deliver them to all stations. The performance of both methods has been verified by the simulation using MATLAB. The collaborative collection method is able to surpass the individual collection method with up to 15.4{\%} reduction in maximum traveling cost.},

This paper describe a multi-agent approach to the operational control of AGVs by integration of path generation, enumerating time-windows, searching interruptions, adjusting waiting time and taking decisions on the selection of routes. It presents an efficient algorithm and rules for finding a conflict-free shortest-time path for AGVs, which is applicable to a bi- and unidirectional flow path network. The concept of loop formation in a flow path network is introduced to deal with the parking of idle vehicles, without obstructing the path of moveable AGVs. The concept of loop formation at nodes reduces the timing-taking task of finding the dynamic positioning of idle AGVs in the network.},

The paper presents a novel control strategy to avoid deadlock and collisions in zone-controlled AGVS. In particular, the control scheme manages the assignments of new paths to vehicles and their acquisition of the next zone. Moreover, the use of coloured Petri nets is proposed to model the dynamics of AGVS and implement the control strategy stemming from the knowledge of the system state. Additionally, extending the coloured Petri net model with a time concept allows investigation of system performance. Several simulations of an AGVS with varying fleet size while measuring appropriate performance indices show the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy compared with an alternative policy previously presented.},

Conflicts between multiple aircraft are resolved in a sequential, decentralized fashion, in which each aircraft takes into account the latest trajectory and loiter pattern of the other aircraft. Besides maintaining feasibility, if the problem is too complex to be solved within the time constraints of a real- time system, this approach also provides an a priori safe rescue solution consisting of the previous trajectories and individual loiter patterns.

Most popular algorithms for multirobot planning manage the complexity of the problem by planning trajectories for robots individually; such decoupled methods are not guaranteed to find a solution if one exists. In contrast, this paper describes a multiphase approach to the planning problem that uses a graph and spanning tree representation to create and maintain obstacle-free paths through the environment for each robot to reach its goal. The resulting algorithm guarantees a solution for a well-defined number of robots in a common environment. The computational cost is shown to be scalable with complexity linear in the number of the robots, and demonstrated by solving the planning problem for 100 robots, simulated in an underground mine environment, in less than 1.5 s with a 1.5 GHz processor. The practicality of the algorithm is demonstrated in a real-world application requiring coordinated motion planning of multiple physical robots. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present an algorithm for decentralized control of multiple automated guided vehicles performing transportation tasks within industrial and warehousing environments. By running on each vehicle in the system, the algorithm provides vehicles with capabilities for autonomous path planning and motion co-ordination. The path planning part of the algorithm implements a free-ranging motion scheme by determining the shortest feasible paths considering nonholonomic vehicle constraints. The motion co-ordination part of the algorithm ensures safe vehicle motions by reliable detection and resolution of different conflict situations with other vehicles in the shared workspace. Conflict resolution is based on a vehicle priority scheme and results in temporary stopping or removal of the lower priority vehicles taking part in the conflict. Removal action is always performed within the vehicle's private zone, i.e., the pre-allocated local region of the workspace surrounding the vehicle. By encoding information on the vehicle size and its kinematic constraints, the introduced private zone mechanism provides the necessary physical space required for successful execution of every removal action. We also analyze the stability of the presented algorithm and discuss its deadlock-free and livelock-free properties. Algorithm performance has been validated by simulation using ten vehicles and experimentally on two different setups-a laboratory setup comprising five Pioneer 3DX vehicles and by two state-of-the-art autonomous forklifts in industrial-like operating conditions.},

@article{Dresner2008,
abstract = {Artificial intelligence research is ushering in a new era of sophisticated, mass-market transportation technology. While computers can already fly a passenger jet better than a trained human pilot, people are still faced with the dangerous yet tedious task of driving automobiles. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is the field that focuses on integrating information technology with vehicles and transportation infrastructure to make transportation safer, cheaper, and more efficient. Recent advances in ITS point to a future in which vehicles themselves handle the vast majority of the driving task. Once autonomous vehicles become popular, autonomous interactions amongst multiple vehicles will be possible. Current methods of vehicle coordination, which are all designed to work with human drivers, will be outdated. The bottleneck for roadway efficiency will no longer be the drivers, but rather the mechanism by which those drivers' actions are coordinated. While open-road driving is a well-studied and more-or-less-solved problem, urban traffic scenarios, especially intersections, are much more challenging. We believe current methods for controlling traffic, specifically at intersections, will not be able to take advantage of the increased sensitivity and precision of autonomous vehicles as compared to human drivers. In this article, we suggest an alternative mechanism for coordinating the movement of autonomous vehicles through intersections. Drivers and intersections in this mechanism are treated as autonomous agents in a multiagent system. In this multiagent system, intersections use a new reservation-based approach built around a detailed communication protocol, which we also present. We demonstrate in simulation that our new mechanism has the potential to significantly outperform current intersection control technology—traffic lights and stop signs. Because our mechanism can emulate a traffic light or stop sign, it subsumes the most popular current methods of intersection control. This article also presents two extensions to the mechanism. The first extension allows the system to control human-driven vehicles in addition to autonomous vehicles. The second gives priority to emergency vehicles without significant cost to civilian vehicles. The mechanism, including both extensions, is implemented and tested in simulation, and we present experimental results that strongly attest to the efficacy of this approach.},

@article{Bennewitz2001,
abstract = {Coordinating the motion of multiple mobile robots is one of the fundamental problems in robotics. The predominant algorithms for coordinating teams of robots are decoupled and prioritized, thereby avoiding combinatorially hard planning problems typically faced by centralized approaches. While these methods are very efficient, they have two major drawbacks. First, they are incomplete, i.e. they sometimes fail to find a solution even if one exists, and second, the resulting solutions are often not optimal. In this paper we present a method for finding and optimizing priority schemes for such prioritized and decoupled planning techniques. Existing approaches apply a single priority scheme which makes them overly prone to failure in cases where valid solutions exist. By searching in the space of priorization schemes, our approach overcomes this limitation. It performs a randomized search with hill-climbing to find solutions and to minimize the overall path length. To focus the search, our algorithm is guided by constraints generated from the task specification. To illustrate the appropriateness of this approach, this paper discusses experimental results obtained with real robots and through systematic robot simulation. The experimental results illustrate the superior performance of our approach, both in terms of efficiency of robot motion and in the ability to find valid plans.},

Results show that high-quality paths can be produced in less than a second of computation time, even in confined environments involving many robots. We examine three issues in particular in this paper: the assignment of priorities to the robots, the performance of prioritized planning versus coordinated planning, and the influence of the extent by which the robot motions are constrained on the performance of the method. Results are reported in terms of both running time and the quality of the paths produced. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel method for highly-scalable coordination of free-ranging automated guided vehicles in industrial logistics and manufacturing scenarios. The primary aim of this method is to enhance the current industrial state-of-the-art multi-vehicle transportation systems, which, despite their long presence on the factory floor and significant advances over the last decades, still rely on a centralized controller and predetermined network of paths. In order to eliminate the major drawbacks of such systems, including poor scalability, low flexibility, and the presence of a single point of failure, in the proposed control approach vehicles autonomously execute their assigned pick-up and delivery operations by running a fully decentralized control algorithm. The algorithm integrates path planning and motion coordination capabilities and relies on a two-layer control architecture with topological workspace representation on the top layer and state-lattice representation on the bottom layer. Each vehicle plans its own shortest feasible path toward the assigned goal location and resolves conflict situations with other vehicles as they arise along the way. The motion coordination strategy relies on the private-zone mechanism ensuring reliable collision avoidance, and local negotiations within the limited communication radius ensuring high scalability as the number of vehicles in the fleet increases. We present experimental validation results obtained on a system comprising six Pioneer 3DX robots in four different scenarios and simulation results with up to fifty vehicles. We also analyze the overall quality of the proposed traffic management method and compare its performance to other state-of-the-art multi-vehicle coordination approaches.},

Currently, AGVs are also used for repeating transportation tasks in other areas, such as warehouses, container terminals and external (underground) transportation systems. This paper discusses literature related to design and control issues of AGV systems at manufacturing, distribution, transshipment and transportation systems. It is concluded that most models can be applied for design problems at manufacturing centres. Some of these models and new models already proved to be successful in large AGV systems. In fact, new analytical and simulation models need to be developed for large AGV systems to overcome large computation times, NP-completeness, congestion, deadlocks and delays in the system and finite planning horizons.

abstract = {One of the challenging optimization problems is determining the minimizer of a nonlinear programming problem that has binary variables. A vexing difficulty is the rate the work to solve such problems increases as the number of discrete variables increases. Any such problem with bounded discrete variables, especially binary variables, may be transformed to that of finding a global optimum of a problem in continuous variables. However, the transformed problems usually have astronomically large numbers of local minimizers, making them harder to solve than typical global optimization problems. Despite this apparent disadvantage, we show that the approach is not futile if we use smoothing techniques. The method we advocate first convexifies the problem and then solves a sequence of subproblems, whose solutions form a trajectory that leads to the solution. To illustrate how well the algorithm performs we show the computational results of applying it to problems taken from the literature and new test problems with known optimal solutions. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {The exchange of information requires the shortest path route to optimize data transmission process. The complexity of the shortest path algorithm becomes important because of the device processing power and memory limitation. This study compared Dijkstra algorithm, A* algorithm and Floyd-Warshall algorithm in term of the time, the computational load and memory usage. OMNeT++ network simulator is used to map the vertices and edge into a collection of nodes and channels that are interconnected. Mesh topology is used in this study to represent a real network conditions. Each edge in the mesh network has a value so as to form a weighted graph. The complexity of the route will be proportional to the scale of the mesh network. Based on the simulation, the value of computational load and simulation time are proportional to the square of the number of nodes for all simulated algorithms. The results show that A* algorithm has smaller computational load and simulation time than the other algorithms without affecting the shortest route results. Dijkstra algorithm performs better in term of memory usage. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is the worst of all simulated algorithm, because all data channel weights needs to be processed using a multi level loop operation. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

        abstract = {The traffic simulation software SUMO supports the simulation of various kinds of network infrastructure such as bus stops, traffic detectors and variable speed signs. This network
infrastructure is configured with various parameters in regard to its location and functionality. So far, the definition and customization of these infrastructure objects required writing
custom XML files which is a tedious and error-prone endeavor. To simplify this task the visual network editor Netedit is being extend to support the creation and customization of
infrastructure objects. The GUI facilities should provide for an intuitive user experience and the architecture is designed with user-defined infrastructure types in mind.}

@book{Boyd2004,
abstract = {Convex optimization problems arise frequently in many different fields. This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the subject, and shows in detail how such problems can be solved numerically with great efficiency. The book begins with the basic elements of convex sets and functions, and then describes various classes of convex optimization problems. Duality and approximation techniques are then covered, as are statistical estimation techniques. Various geometrical problems are then presented, and there is detailed discussion of unconstrained and constrained minimization problems, and interior-point methods. The focus of the book is on recognizing convex optimization problems and then finding the most appropriate technique for solving them. It contains many worked examples and homework exercises and will appeal to students, researchers and practitioners in fields such as engineering, computer science, mathematics, statistics, finance and economics.},
