	abstract = {The article presents design and construction of the light two-wheeled vehicle powered by the brushless DC motor of 3 kW. The construction of the vehicle is based on a steel frame similar to the classical bicycle frame. The vehicle has been additionally equipped with pedals as an alternative driving source as well as with the standard motorcycle equipment, i.e. lamps, breaking light, horn, front disc brake, etc. The prime power source which is the BLDC motor has been installed in the rear wheel hub and is powered by a pack of 220 lithium-ion power cells of 2600 mAh each. The nominal parameters of the designed power pack is 72 V and 27.5 Ah of capacity. The motor controller which can be powered by the voltage from 36 V to 95 V can deliver up to 80 A of current. It enables regenerative braking which increases an overall range of the vehicle. The article discusses also the problem of classification of such construction according to the Polish law described in the Act on the Law of Road Traffic as well as in the Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure of 31 December 2002 on the technical conditions of vehicles and the scope of their necessary equipment. Finally, the designed construction has been tested on the MAHA LPS 3000 chassis dynamometer in order to measure mechanical and electrical parameters like maximal electric power of the motor, maximal mechanical power on the wheel, motor torque, maximal rotational speed, energy consumption, windings temperature reached, etc. These quantities will serve to further development of the designed construction.},
