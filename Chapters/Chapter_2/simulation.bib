	abstract = {The article presents design and construction of the light two-wheeled vehicle powered by the brushless DC motor of 3 kW. The construction of the vehicle is based on a steel frame similar to the classical bicycle frame. The vehicle has been additionally equipped with pedals as an alternative driving source as well as with the standard motorcycle equipment, i.e. lamps, breaking light, horn, front disc brake, etc. The prime power source which is the BLDC motor has been installed in the rear wheel hub and is powered by a pack of 220 lithium-ion power cells of 2600 mAh each. The nominal parameters of the designed power pack is 72 V and 27.5 Ah of capacity. The motor controller which can be powered by the voltage from 36 V to 95 V can deliver up to 80 A of current. It enables regenerative braking which increases an overall range of the vehicle. The article discusses also the problem of classification of such construction according to the Polish law described in the Act on the Law of Road Traffic as well as in the Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure of 31 December 2002 on the technical conditions of vehicles and the scope of their necessary equipment. Finally, the designed construction has been tested on the MAHA LPS 3000 chassis dynamometer in order to measure mechanical and electrical parameters like maximal electric power of the motor, maximal mechanical power on the wheel, motor torque, maximal rotational speed, energy consumption, windings temperature reached, etc. These quantities will serve to further development of the designed construction.},

	abstract = {In this study a control system to coordinate the traffic flow of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) is presented. This control system, TRACES (Traffic Control Engineering System), coordinates a system of AGVs, which are autonomous transport units. A prototype was built as a pilot-study for the TRACES system. The formulation of the problem and simulation environment in which TRACES was tested is discussed. For this study of the system an existing automated container terminal has been chosen. Here about 50 AGVs operating in a relatively small area look after the transport of containers between the quay where ships are loaded and unloaded and the stack where containers are stored for longer or shorter periods. Conclusions from this research and future research and applications are presented.},

@article{Lee2019,
	abstract = {The deployment of automated guided vehicles in the automated warehouse has a great impact on the capacity in handling logistics activities. Simulation offers practical feedback and analytical solution at a designing stage of engineering applications. As for automated warehouse system, the optimal set of the combination of automated guided vehicles and workstations are highly depended on the size, dimensions, layout structure of the warehouse and working process. In this paper, the operations in the automatic warehouse were simulated to determine possible scenarios of the warehouse setting regarding the demand pattern of the packaging order. In the automatic warehouse, the racks are transferred by the automated guided vehicles to the workstations. The contribution of the study is that it not only considers the optimal number of AGV but also the optimal number of workstation for automatic warehouse. To estimate the possible setting with the highest order turn-over rate, varies scenarios were considered in the model. As a result, the estimated layout and warehouse setting were suggested.
