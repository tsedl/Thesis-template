	abstract = {The article presents design and construction of the light two-wheeled vehicle powered by the brushless DC motor of 3 kW. The construction of the vehicle is based on a steel frame similar to the classical bicycle frame. The vehicle has been additionally equipped with pedals as an alternative driving source as well as with the standard motorcycle equipment, i.e. lamps, breaking light, horn, front disc brake, etc. The prime power source which is the BLDC motor has been installed in the rear wheel hub and is powered by a pack of 220 lithium-ion power cells of 2600 mAh each. The nominal parameters of the designed power pack is 72 V and 27.5 Ah of capacity. The motor controller which can be powered by the voltage from 36 V to 95 V can deliver up to 80 A of current. It enables regenerative braking which increases an overall range of the vehicle. The article discusses also the problem of classification of such construction according to the Polish law described in the Act on the Law of Road Traffic as well as in the Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure of 31 December 2002 on the technical conditions of vehicles and the scope of their necessary equipment. Finally, the designed construction has been tested on the MAHA LPS 3000 chassis dynamometer in order to measure mechanical and electrical parameters like maximal electric power of the motor, maximal mechanical power on the wheel, motor torque, maximal rotational speed, energy consumption, windings temperature reached, etc. These quantities will serve to further development of the designed construction.},

	abstract = {In this study a control system to coordinate the traffic flow of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) is presented. This control system, TRACES (Traffic Control Engineering System), coordinates a system of AGVs, which are autonomous transport units. A prototype was built as a pilot-study for the TRACES system. The formulation of the problem and simulation environment in which TRACES was tested is discussed. For this study of the system an existing automated container terminal has been chosen. Here about 50 AGVs operating in a relatively small area look after the transport of containers between the quay where ships are loaded and unloaded and the stack where containers are stored for longer or shorter periods. Conclusions from this research and future research and applications are presented.},

@article{Lee2019,
	abstract = {The deployment of automated guided vehicles in the automated warehouse has a great impact on the capacity in handling logistics activities. Simulation offers practical feedback and analytical solution at a designing stage of engineering applications. As for automated warehouse system, the optimal set of the combination of automated guided vehicles and workstations are highly depended on the size, dimensions, layout structure of the warehouse and working process. In this paper, the operations in the automatic warehouse were simulated to determine possible scenarios of the warehouse setting regarding the demand pattern of the packaging order. In the automatic warehouse, the racks are transferred by the automated guided vehicles to the workstations. The contribution of the study is that it not only considers the optimal number of AGV but also the optimal number of workstation for automatic warehouse. To estimate the possible setting with the highest order turn-over rate, varies scenarios were considered in the model. As a result, the estimated layout and warehouse setting were suggested.

@article{He2020,
	abstract = {With the rapid development and application of vehicle communication technology and autonomous driving technology, the traffic flow of freeways and urban roads will inevitably change from traditional traffic flow (all vehicles are controlled by human drivers) to heterogeneous traffic flow (including CACC and other autonomous vehicles). At present, in the field of heterogeneous traffic flow, scholars mostly take modeling and simulation as the means to study the impact of heterogeneous flow in the freeway scene, but few studies discuss the impact of heterogeneous traffic flow on urban roads, especially in the scene of signal control area. In view of this, taking the IDM model as the traditional traffic flow model and the ACC model proposed by University of California at Berkeley as an automatic driving model, this paper builds a heterogeneous traffic flow model in the vicinity of intersections at the background of typical urban traffic scene and also preliminary explore the influence mechanism of the mix of autopilot on the traffic flow in the signal control area through simulation experiments , which can provide reference for the development and application of automatic driving technology.},

@article{Carey2014,
	abstract = {In traffic assignment models with time-varying flows (dynamic network loading or dynamic traffic assignment), overtaking behaviour is normally not included in the model and, in that case, it is important that the model at least approximates first-in-first-out (FIFO), to prevent deviations from FIFO that are arbitrary or unrealistic or not physically possible. For the cell transmission model (CTM) it has recently been shown that the usual recommended method for preserving FIFO will ensure FIFO for each cell taken separately but does not fully ensure FIFO in the transition between cells and hence does not fully ensure FIFO for sequences of cells or for links or for routes. As a result, deviations from FIFO can easily occur and cumulate along the links or routes. In view of that, we define and analyse three different levels of satisfaction or approximation of FIFO, together with corresponding methods for achieving them. Two of these are existing methods and one is new. We develop, analyse and compare the three methods and the extent to which each of them adheres to FIFO for sequences of cells and links or routes. Also, for two of the methods we present a more detailed algorithm for applying them within the CTM. The paper is concerned with how to implement FIFO in the CTM and not with testing for FIFO or measuring deviations from FIFO. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},
