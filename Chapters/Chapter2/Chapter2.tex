\section{Introduction}
AGV typically have their motion restricted to a roadmap connecting pick and drop locations \cite{Cardarelli2017}. This reduces the search space to make conflict free routing of multiple vehicles between different origins and destinations feasible. \cite{Digani2015} proposes a two level decomposition of the problem with the detailed roadmap at the bottom and a higher level abstraction of zones around each intersection above. The conflict avoidance is handled with local information within each zone. The routing decisions are made at high level, utilizing a traffic model where each intersection has a fixed capacity (number of vehicles).
