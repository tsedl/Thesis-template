abstract = {—This paper addresses the problem of real-time planning and control of a group of aerial vehicles flying in environments with obstacles and subject to disturbances and uncertainties. We present a novel methodology to the coordination of multiple vehicles based on a classical technique known as Closed Loop Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (CL-RRT). We use a distributed processing framework and communication to optimize the plans being executed by each agent of the team, providing better solutions to the execution step of the CL-RRT. This technique endows each agent with the capability to navigate through the environment while avoiding collisions with obstacles as well as with other team agents. The keypoint is a prediction scheme executed by each robot that infers the behavior of the entire team at each time step. We show the applicability of the method by planning and executing waypoint navigation tasks for a group of Micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (MUAVs) – modelled in SE(3) – in outdoor environments.},

abstract = {We propose a planning and control approach to physics-based manipulation. The key feature of the algorithm is that it can adapt to the accuracy requirements of a task, by slowing down and generating `careful' motion when the task requires high accuracy, and by speeding up and moving fast when the task tolerates inaccuracy. We formulate the problem as an MDP with action-dependent stochasticity and propose an approximate online solution to it. We use a trajectory optimizer with a deterministic model to suggest promising actions to the MDP, to reduce computation time spent on evaluating different actions. We conducted experiments in simulation and on a real robotic system. Our results show that with a task-adaptive planning and control approach, a robot can choose fast or slow actions depending on the task accuracy and uncertainty level. The robot makes these decisions online and is able to maintain high success rates while completing manipulation tasks as fast as possible.},

abstract = {Microelectrode arrays (MEAs) offer numerous benefits over macroelectrodes due to their smaller sample size requirement, small form factor, low-power consumption, and higher sensitivity due to increased rates of mass transport. These features make MEAs well suited for microfluidic lab-on-a-chip applications. This paper presents two implementations of MEAs with and without an on chip potentiostat. We first describe an 8times8 array of 6 mum circular microelectrodes with center to center 37 mum spacing fabricated on silicon using conventional microfabrication techniques. Pads are provided for external connections to a potentiostat for electrochemical analysis. The second implementation is an individually addressable 32times32 array of 7 mum square microelectrodes with 37 mum center to center spacing on a CMOS chip with built-in very-large-scale integration potentiostat for electrochemical analysis. The integrated CMOS MEA is post processed at the die level to coat the exposed Al layers with Au. To verify microelectrode array behavior with individual addressability, cyclic voltammetry was performed using a potassium ferricyanide (K3Fe(CN)6) solution.},

@article{Karaman2011,
abstract = {During the last decade, sampling-based path planning algorithms, such as Probabilistic RoadMaps (PRM) and Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), have been shown to work well in practice and possess theoretical guarantees such as probabilistic completeness. However, little effort has been devoted to the formal analysis of the quality of the solution returned by such algorithms, e.g., as a function of the number of samples. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, by rigorously analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the cost of the solution returned by stochastic sampling-based algorithms as the number of samples increases. A number of negative results are provided, characterizing existing algorithms, e.g., showing that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based algorithms converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of new algorithms, namely, PRM* and RRT*, which are provably asymptotically optimal, i.e., such that the cost of the returned solution converges almost surely to the optimum. Moreover, it is shown that the computational complexity of the new algorithms is within a constant factor of that of their probabilistically complete (but not asymptotically optimal) counterparts. The analysis in this paper hinges on novel connections between stochastic sampling-based path planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs.},

@article{Alonso-Mora2018,
abstract = {—In this paper, we present a method, namely CCA, for collision avoidance in dynamic environments among interacting agents, such as other robots or humans. Given a preferred motion by a global planner or driver, the method computes a collision-free local motion for a short time horizon, which respects the actuator constraints and allows for smooth and safe control. The method builds on the concept of reciprocal velocity obstacles and extends it to respect the kinodynamic constraints of the robot and account for a grid-based map representation of the environment. The method is best suited for large multirobot settings, including heteroge-neous teams of robots, in which computational complexity is of paramount importance and the robots interact with one another. In particular, we consider a set of motion primitives for the robot and solve an optimization in the space of control velocities with additional constraints. Additionally, we propose a cooperative ap-proach to compute safe velocity partitions in the distributed case. We describe several instances of the method for distributed and centralized operation and formulated both as convex and noncon-vex optimizations. We compare the different variants and describe the benefits and tradeoffs both theoretically and in extensive exper-iments with various robotic platforms: robotic wheelchairs, robotic boats, humanoid robots, small unicycle robots, and simulated cars.},

Interacting, exploring, and working with humans, the new generation of robots will increasingly touch people and their lives. The credible prospect of practical robots among humans is the result of the scientific endeavour of a half a century of robotic developments that established robotics as a modern scientific discipline. The contents have been restructured to achieve four main objectives: the enlargement of foundational topics for robotics, the enlightenment of design of various types of robotic systems, the extension of the treatment on robots moving in the environment, and the enrichment of advanced robotics applications. Further to an extensive update, fifteen new chapters have been introduced on emerging topics.},

abstract = {We present an approach to the problem of differentially constrained mobile robot motion planning in arbitrary cost fields. The approach is based on deterministic search in a specially discretized state space. We compute a set of elementary motions that connects each discrete state value to a set of its reachable neighbors via feasible motions. Thus, this set of motions induces a connected search graph. The motions are carefully designed to terminate at discrete states, whose dimensions include relevant state variables (e.g., position, heading, curvature, and velocity). The discrete states, and thus the motions, repeat at regular intervals, forming a lattice. We ensure that all paths in the graph encode feasible motions via the imposition of continuity constraints on state variables at graph vertices and compliance of the graph edges with a differential equation comprising the vehicle model. The resulting state lattice permits fast full configuration space cost evaluation and collision detection. Experimental results with research prototype rovers demonstrate that the planner allows us to exploit the entire envelope of vehicle maneuverability in rough terrain, while featuring real-time performance.},

abstract = {Autonomous vehicles is a rapidly expanding eld and the need for robust and ecient path planners is high. We approach the global pathplanning problem for an autonomous load carrier for quarry environments, developed at Volvo Construction Equipment, using two methods: a twostep path planning and path smoothing approach, and a method based on an optimal control formulation of the path planning problem. The two-step method is based on smoothing an initial path found by A*, an ecient grid search algorithm, by tting a curve consisting of as few clothoid segments as possible to the A* path. The smoothing is done by rewriting the non-linear optimization problem to a convex form by a linearization of the deviation constraints around the curvature of the A* path. An iterative method is then used to relax the `0-norm, which measures the number of non-zero elements in a vector, with a weighted `1-norm which, in turn, is then solved eciently using CVX in Matlab. The optimal control based path planning method solves the nonlinear optimization problem using IPOPT. It was found that the completeness of the A* algorithm, coupled with the guaranteed solution of a convex problem, resulted in a very robust method that was able to nd paths through mazes and dicult situations. The optimal control approach produced better paths, but had a tendency to sometimes show inconsistent behavior.},
