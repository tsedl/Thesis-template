abstract = {ABSTRACTDue to interference phenomena among unnatural dimensions of the motion robots' operations space, optimal path planning of them has to satisfy not just one criterion, but rather multi-objects. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-object approach for optimal mobile robot path planning, based on bees pollen optimizer (BPO). We consider two objects of distance and smooth path of the special plan for motion robots for constructing a minimization one. In operation environment for action robots, the location of the target and the obstacles are set up for the solution of BPO. The selected sequence of the mobile robot is a set of the chosen global best settlement in each iteration, which updates its archived data throughout the movement for motion robots in order. A series of simulations are executed in some environments for the best pathway once the robot reaches its goal. The results indicate that the proposed approach offered the robot path to its target without touching the obstacles, and the propos...},

@article{Gim2017b,
abstract = {{\textcopyright}2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. This paper addresses a continuous curvature path generation problem for car-like vehicle navigation. The continuous curvature path is generated by multiple clothoids composition and parametric adjustment. According to the geometric conditions of the given initial and final configurations, the path generation problem is classified into two cases and then, each problem is solved by by appropriate proposed algorithm. The solution is obtained by iterative procedure subject to geometric constraint as well as solution constraints. For computational efficiency and fast convergence in the proposed algorithms, a minimax sharpness constraint is proposed as the solution constraint by minimizing the maximum sharpness of the feasible solutions. After the generation of the proposed path, the resultant curvature/sharpness diagram provides a useful information about its orientation and curvature continuity along the travel length. The proposed path planning strategy, permits us to obtain online, smooth and safe path between two defined configurations while ensuring high passengers comfort (continuous curvature and transition between the different composed clothoids). The algorithmic proposals have been applied to generate continuous curvature for two cases. The first correspond to local path planning for ensuring obstacle avoidance or lane change. The second application corresponds to global path smoothing. The resultant global path path is tested on the Lyapunov-based control scheme and showed improved performance on its steering work (reduction of 41.0{\%} than the driving based on the raw data), which permits us therefore to validate the effectiveness of the obtained global path for car-like vehicles path following.},

We compute a set of elementary motions that connects each discrete state value to a set of its reachable neighbors via feasible motions. Thus, this set of motions induces a connected search graph. The motions are carefully designed to terminate at discrete states, whose dimensions include relevant state variables (e.g., position, heading, curvature, and velocity). The discrete states, and thus the motions, repeat at regular intervals, forming a lattice. We ensure that all paths in the graph encode feasible motions via the imposition of continuity constraints on state variables at graph vertices and compliance of the graph edges with a differential equation comprising the vehicle model. The resulting state lattice permits fast full configuration space cost evaluation and collision detection. Experimental results with research prototype rovers demonstrate that the planner allows us to exploit the entire envelope of vehicle maneuverability in rough terrain, while featuring real-time performance.},

abstract = {Autonomous vehicles is a rapidly expanding field, and promise to play an important role in society. The goal of autonomous vehicles is to improve the traffic system in terms of higher efficiency, fewer accidents, lower fuel consumption, less pollution, and shorter travel times. In more isolated environments, such as mines and ports, vehicle automation can bring significant efficiency and production benefits and it eliminates repetitive jobs that can lead to inattention and accidents. The results of this thesis are developed within the iQMatic project, which is lead by Scania CV AB in collaboration with Saab AB, Autoliv, Link{\"{o}}ping University, and KTH, with the goal of developing a fully autonomous truck for mining applications by 2018. The thesis addresses the problem of lateral and longitudinal dynamics control of autonomous ground vehicles with the purpose of accurate and smooth path following. Clothoids are curves with linearly varying curvature, which are widely used in road design due to their smoothness properties. In the thesis, clothoids are used in the design of optimal predictive controllers aimed at minimizing the lateral forces and jerks in the vehicle. First, a clothoid-based path sparsification algorithm is proposed to efficiently describe the reference path. This approach relies on a sparseness regularization technique such that a minimal number of clothoids is used to describe the reference path. Second, a clothoid-based model predictive controller (MPCC) is proposed. This controller aims at producing a smooth driving by taking advantage of the clothoid properties. The motion of a vehicle traveling at low speeds is assumed to define a clothoid segment if the steering angle is chosen to vary piecewise linearly with respect to the traveled distance. Third, an alternative formulation of a controller for smooth driving is presented. In this case, we formulate the problem as an economic model predictive controller (EMPC). In EMPC the objective function contains an economic cost (here represented by comfort or smoothness), which is described by the second and first derivatives of the curvature. This results in that the obtained curvature is approximately linear. Fourth, the generation of feasible speed profiles, and the longitudinal vehicle control for following these, is studied. The speed profile generation is formulated as an optimization problem with two contradictory objectives: to drive as fast as possible (close to the speed limit) while accelerating as little as possible. Constraints are given by vehicle limitations and road geometry. The longitudinal controller is formulated in a similar way, but is implemented in a receding horizon fashion, and provides feasible reference speeds to a cruise controller. Finally, experimental and simulation evaluation are performed. The EMPC is deployed on a Scania construction truck. The experimental evaluation with the EMPC demonstrates its good performance, since the deviation from the path never exceeds 30 cm and in average is 6 cm. A simulation environment is developed allowing evaluation and validation of the control design before deploying it in the experimental platform. The EMPC and the MPCC are compared with a pure-pursuit controller (PPC) and a standard MPC. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of both the MPCC and the EMPC. Furthermore, the EMPC clearly outperforms the PPC in terms of path accuracy and the standard MPC in terms of driving smoothness.},

@article{Gawron2018,
abstract = {Provably correct and computationally efficient path planning in the presence of various constraints is essential for autonomous driving and agile maneuvering of mobile robots. In this paper, we consider the planning of G 3 -continuous planar paths with continuous and limited curvature in a motion environment that is bounded and contains obstacles modeled by a set of (non-convex) polygons. In practice, the curvature constraints often arise from mechanical limitations for the robot, such as limited steering and articulation angles in wheeled robots, or aerodynamic constraints in unmanned aerial vehicles. To solve the planning problem under those stringent constraints, we improve upon known path primitives, such as Reeds–Shepp (RS) and CC-steer (curvature-continuous) paths. Given the initial and final robot configuration, we developed extend-procedure computing paths that can approximate RS paths with arbitrary precision, but guaranteeing G 3 -continuity. We show that satisfaction of all stated path constraints is guaranteed and, contrary to many other methods known from the literature, the method of checking for collisions between the planned path and obstacles is given by a closed-form analytic expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach is not conservative, i.e., it allows for precise maneuvers in tight environments under the assumption of a rectangular robot footprint. The presented extend procedure can be integrated into various motion-planning algorithms available in the literature. In particular, we utilized the Rapidly exploring Random Trees (RRT*) algorithm in conjunction with our extend procedure to demonstrate its feasibility in motion environments of nontrivial complexity and low computational cost in comparison to a G 3 -continuous extend procedure based on {\$}\eta{\$} 3 -splines.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2016 American Society of Civil Engineers. The clothoid (also known as Cornu spiral or Euler spiral) is a curve that is characterized by its curvature being proportional to its length. This property makes it very useful as a transition curve when designing the layout of roads and railway tracks. This paper presents an analysis of two methods for computing the clothoid: the classical method, which is based on the use of explicit formulas obtained from Taylor expansions of sine and cosine functions, and an alternative algorithm, which is based on the numerical solution of the initial value problems giving the clothoid parametrization. This alternative method is simple and efficient, and its effectiveness is shown through its application to three classical problems of horizontal road alignment.},

abstract = {The path taken by a car with a given minimum turning radius has a 
lower bound on its radius of curvature at each point, but the path has cusps if the car shifts into or out of reverse gear. What is the shortest such path a car can travel between two points if its starting and ending directions are specified? One need consider only paths with at most 2 cusps or reversals. We give a set of paths which is sufficient in the sense that it always contains a shortest path and small in the sense that there are at most 68, but usually many fewer paths in the set for any pair of endpoints and directions. We give these paths by explicit formula. Calculating the length of each of these paths and selecting the (not necessarily unique) path with smallest length yields a simple algorithm for a shortest path in each case. These optimal paths or geodesies may be described as follows: If C is an arc of a circle of the minimal turning radius and S is a line segment, then it is sufficient to consider only certain paths of the form CCSCC where arcs and segments fit smoothly, one or more of the arcs or segments may vanish, and where reversals, or equivalently cusps, between arcs or segments are allowed. This contrasts with the case when cusps are not allowed, where Dubins (1957) has shown that paths of the form CCC and CSC suffice.},

The elastica can be understood from a number of different aspects, including as a mechanical equilibrium, a problem of the calculus of variations, and the solution to elliptic integrals. In addition, it has a number of analogies with physical systems, including a sheet holding a volume of water, the surface of a capillary, and the motion of a simple pendulum. It is also the mathematical model of the mechanical spline, used for shipbuilding and similar applications, and directly insipired the modern theory of mathematical splines. More recently, the major focus has been on efficient numerical techniques for computing the elastica and fitting it to spline problems. All in all, it is a beautiful family of curves based on beautiful mathematics and a rich and fascinating history. This report is adapted from a Ph. D. thesis done under the direction of Prof. C. H.

abstract = {We present a new approach to the design of smooth trajectories for quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are free of collisions with obstacles along their entire length. To avoid the non-convex constraints normally required for obstacle-avoidance, we perform a mixed-integer optimization in which polynomial trajectories are assigned to convex regions which are known to be obstacle-free. Prior approaches have used the faces of the obstacles themselves to define these convex regions. We instead use IRIS, a recently developed technique for greedy convex segmentation [1], to pre-compute convex regions of safe space. This results in a substantially reduced number of integer variables, which improves the speed with which the optimization can be solved to its global optimum, even for tens or hundreds of obstacle faces. In addition, prior approaches have typically enforced obstacle avoidance at a finite set of sample or knot points. We introduce a technique based on sums-of-squares (SOS) programming that allows us to ensure that the entire piecewise polynomial trajectory is free of collisions using convex constraints. We demonstrate this technique in 2D and in 3D using a dynamical model in the Drake toolbox for Matlab [2].},

CC Steer also verifies a topological property that ensures that when it is used within a general motion-planning scheme, it yields a complete collision-free path planner. The coupling of CC Steer with a general planning scheme yields a path planner that computes collision-free paths verifying the properties mentioned above. Accordingly, a car-like vehicle can followsuch paths without ever having to stop in order to reorient its front wheels. Besides, such paths can be followed with a nominal speed which is proportional to the curvature derivative limit. The paths computed by CC Steer are made up of line segments, circular arcs, and clothoid arcs. They are not optimal in length. However, it is shown that they converge toward the optimal “Reeds and Shepp” paths when the curvature derivative upper bound tends to infinity. The capabilities of CC Steer to serve as an efficient steering method within two general planning schemes are also demonstrated. Index},

abstract = {The combination of low-frequency lateral and roll motions experienced in tilting trains can provoke motion sickness. The incidence of sickness depends on vehicle design and subject demographics. Vehicle design affects the location of the centre-of-roll, which influences passenger perception of motion. Age and gender have large influences on susceptibility to sickness, but little is known about the effects of ethnicity and body size. This study investigated the influence of both the vertical position of the centre-of-roll and subject characteristics (ethnicity, weight, stature and sickness susceptibility) on sickness caused by fully roll-compensated lateral oscillation. It was hypothesised that sickness would be greater when full compensation occurred at the head than when full compensation occurred at the seat. Sixty subjects experienced a 0.2-Hz lateral oscillation combined with {\{}+/-{\}}7.3{\{}degrees{\}} of roll, so that the lateral acceleration was fully compensated at either the seat surface or 800 mm above the seat (i.e. average head height). Illness ratings and symptom scores were recorded every minute for 50 min (i.e. during a 5-min acclimatisation period, a 30-min exposure period and a 15-min recovery period). Although the mean illness ratings were greater when full compensation occurred at the head than at the seat, the difference was not statistically significant. Weight and stature were not associated with motion sickness, but illness ratings were much greater in Asian subjects than in European subjects. It is concluded that differences in susceptibility between Asians and Europeans have a greater effect on motion sickness than the height of the centre-of-rotation during roll-compensated lateral acceleration.},

We present a fast and exact planner for our mobile robot model, based upon recursive subdivision of a collision-free path generated by a lower-level geometric planner that ignores the motion constraints. The resultant trajectory is optimized to give a path that is of near-minimal length in its homotopy class. Our claims of high speed are supported by experimental results for implementations that assume a robot moving amid polygonal obstacles. The completeness and the complexity of the algorithm are proven using an appropriate metric in the configuration space R {\textless} sup {\textgreater} 2 {\textless} /sup {\textgreater} × S {\textless} sup {\textgreater} 1 {\textless} /sup {\textgreater} of the robot. This metric is defined by using the length of the shortest paths in the absence of obstacles as the distance between two configurations. We prove that the new induced topology and the classical one are the same.

As a result, even the 'op-timal' grid planners produce unnatural, suboptimal paths for the agent to traverse. Our approach uses linear interpolation during planning to calculate accurate path cost estimates for arbitrary positions within each grid cell and to produce paths with a range of continuous headings.

We focus on a controlled object whose goal is to avoid obstacles while moving in an n-dimensional space. The proposed reformulation does not introduce approximations, and applies to general obstacles and controlled objects that can be represented in an n-dimensional space as the finite union of convex sets. Furthermore, we connect our results with the notion of signed distance, which is widely used in traditional trajectory generation algorithms. Our method can be used in generic navigation and trajectory planning tasks, and the smoothness property allows the use of general-purpose gradient- and Hessian-based optimization algorithms. Finally, in case a collision cannot be avoided, our framework allows us to find "least-intrusive" trajectories, measured in terms of penetration. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on a quadcopter navigation and automated parking problem, and our numerical experiments suggest that the proposed methods enable real-time optimization-based trajectory planning problems in tight environments.

abstract = {—In this paper, we present an algorithm for lateral control of a vehicle – a smooth and accurate model predictive controller. The fundamental difference compared to a standard MPC is that the driving smoothness is directly addressed in the cost function. The controller objective is based on the minimization of the first-and second-order spatial derivatives of the curvature. By doing so, jerky commands to the steering wheel, which could lead to permanent damage on the steering components and vehicle structure, are avoided. A good path tracking accuracy is ensured by adding constraints to avoid deviations from the reference path. Finally, the controller is experimentally tested and evaluated on a Scania construction truck. The evaluation is performed at Scania's facilities near S{\"{o}}dert{\"{a}}lje, Sweden via two different paths: a precision track that resembles a mining scenario and a high-speed test track that resembles a highway situation. Even using a linearized kinematic vehicle to predict the vehicle motion, the performance of the proposed controller is encouraging, since the deviation from the path never exceeds 30 cm. It clearly outperforms an industrial pure-pursuit controller in terms of path accuracy and a standard MPC in terms of driving smoothness.},

Thirdly,robot configurations are placed along the selected path in the way that the robot can move from one configuration to the nextavoiding obstacles. Lemmas are introduced to ensure that the robot travels using direct, indirect or reversal manoeuvres. Thealgorithm is computationally efficient and runs in time O(nk + n log n) for k obstacles andn vertices. The path found is near optimal in terms of distance travelled. The algorithm is tested in computersimulations and test results are presented to demonstrate its versatility in complex environments.},

abstract = {During the last decade, sampling-based path planning algorithms, such as Probabilistic RoadMaps (PRM) and Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), have been shown to work well in practice and possess theoretical guarantees such as probabilistic completeness. However, little effort has been devoted to the formal analysis of the quality of the solution returned by such algorithms, e.g., as a function of the number of samples. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, by rigorously analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the cost of the solution returned by stochastic sampling-based algorithms as the number of samples increases. A number of negative results are provided, characterizing existing algorithms, e.g., showing that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based algorithms converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of new algorithms, namely, PRM* and RRT*, which are provably asymptotically optimal, i.e., such that the cost of the returned solution converges almost surely to the optimum. Moreover, it is shown that the computational complexity of the new algorithms is within a constant factor of that of their probabilistically complete (but not asymptotically optimal) counterparts. The analysis in this paper hinges on novel connections between stochastic sampling-based path planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs.},

abstract = {Transportation has been a crucial aspect of human life for decades. Road traffic congestion is a critical socio-economic issue as it causes high fuel consumption, waste of time, increased environmental pollution, frustration and safety issues. Major reason for increased road traffic congestion is the suboptimal use of available resources such as time and road space due to the static traffic signal plan. Traffic density at multiple adjacent intersections is not effectively considered in current traffic signal control plans. Novel perimeter gating control mechanism based on the dynamic traffic conditions in multiple intersections is proposed using multi-agent systems to improve the throughput of macroscopic traffic networks. Multi-agent systems facilitate the communication and coordination between adjacent intersections. Goal is to attain the emerging effect of minimizing the time loss due to traffic congestion over time for a selected area. Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) traffic simulation suite along with Java Agent Development Environment (JADE) is used to assess the proposed perimeter gating control mechanism. Experimental results show that the proposed method reduces the time loss by 34{\%} when compared with static traffic control method.},

abstract = {This paper presents a model-predictive approach for trajectory generation of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) combined with a tire model. An optimal tracking problem while avoiding collision with obstacles is formulated in terms of cost minimization under constraints. Information on obstacles is incorporated online in the nonlinear model-predictive framework as they are sensed within a limited sensing range. The overall problem is solved online with nonlinear programming. For the local path regeneration upon detecting new obstacles, the cost function is augmented using the obstacle information in two methods. The first method uses the distance from the UGV to the nearest detected obstacle, and the second method uses the parallax information from the vehicle about the detected obstacles. Simulation results in cluttered and dynamic environments show that the modified parallax method effectively reflects the threat of the obstacles to the UGV considering the dimension and state variables of the vehicle, showing clear improvements over the distance-based methods. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper we propose a generic model of cooperation among vehicles, which is designed not to saturate the communication medium and to be insensitive to information loss among vehicles. We also propose an original software simulator, which helps us to show how this model can be used in realistic traffic situations. In the simulation, we evaluate one instance of our model, which features an algorithm for limiting the risks of information storms. This feature is particularly interesting in urban settings, where radio communication must fit within the traditional IEEE-802.11 traffic. We show that this algorithm can considerably reduce the amount of communication, without affecting the quality of traffic self-organization. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Existing congestion management techniques in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have not been very effective due to lack of autonomous and collaborative behavior of the constituent traffic control entities involved in these techniques. Moreover, these entities cannot easily adapt to the traffic dynamics and the traffic control intelligence is mostly centralised making it susceptible to overload and failures. The autonomous and distributed nature of multi-agent systems is well-suited to the transportation domain which is dynamic and geographically distributed. This paper reviews existing congestion management techniques and discusses their limitations. The paper, further, comprehensively surveys multi-agent techniques for congestion management in ITS and describes their advantages over other existing techniques. The paper classifies the multi-agent techniques based on the locus of decision control intelligence and focuses on their suitability of application in congestion management. We conclude with outstanding issues and challenges.},

abstract = {We present a new approach to the design of smooth trajectories for quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are free of collisions with obstacles along their entire length. To avoid the non-convex constraints normally required for obstacle-avoidance, we perform a mixed-integer optimization in which polynomial trajectories are assigned to convex regions which are known to be obstacle-free. Prior approaches have used the faces of the obstacles themselves to define these convex regions. We instead use IRIS, a recently developed technique for greedy convex segmentation [1], to pre-compute convex regions of safe space. This results in a substantially reduced number of integer variables, which improves the speed with which the optimization can be solved to its global optimum, even for tens or hundreds of obstacle faces. In addition, prior approaches have typically enforced obstacle avoidance at a finite set of sample or knot points. We introduce a technique based on sums-of-squares (SOS) programming that allows us to ensure that the entire piecewise polynomial trajectory is free of collisions using convex constraints. We demonstrate this technique in 2D and in 3D using a dynamical model in the Drake toolbox for Matlab [2].},

abstract = {We discuss traffic patterns generated by swarms of robots while commuting to and from a base station. The overall question is whether to explicitly organise the traffic or whether a certain regularity develops `naturally'. Human driven motorized traffic is rigidly structured in two lanes. However, army ants develop a three-lane pattern in their traffic, while human pedestrians generate a main trail and secondary trials in either direction. Our robot swarm approach is bottom-up: designing individual agents we first investigate the mathematics of cases occurring when applying the artificial potential field method to three 'perfect' robots. We show that traffic lane pattern will not be disturbed by the internal system of forces. Next, we define models of sensor designs to account for the practical fact that robots (and ants) have limited visibility and compare the sensor models in groups of three robots. In the final step we define layouts of a highway: an unbounded open space, a trail with surpassable edges and a hard defined (walled) highway. Having defined the preliminaries we run swarm simulations and look for emerging traffic patterns. Apparently, depending on the initial situation a variety of lane patterns occurs, however, high traffic densities do delay the emergence of traffic lanes considerably. Overall we conclude that regularities do emerge naturally and can be turned into an advantage to obtain efficient robot traffic.},

This work focuses specifically on the impact on road network capacity, and hence traffic speeds, delay and journey time. There are many other likely areas of impact – such as safety, emissions, car ownership and travel demand – that are all subject to on-going research. As a first stage, this report captures current thinking and gaps in knowledge to steer future work on capacity. It focuses on recent scientific evidence, backed up by discussions with leading researchers and industry globally. This focus is needed because much of the headline information attached to CAV benefits comes from think pieces, and evidence drawn from early speculative work. Much of this is now outdated, as both technology and market needs have changed. Early work tended to assume 100{\%} fleet penetration of CAVs, that no pedestrians or cyclists exist, used hypothetical roads and assumed high levels of user compliance. Later work has explored mixed penetration using examples of real-world situations, and undertaken real-world testing to understand how drivers and other road users might react to the technology, and how they might use it (or even turn it off). This work has refined and reduced the headline capacity benefits from early studies and, in some cases, highlighted disbenefits. However, it is important to recognise that there are still many unsupported and unsubstantiated claims about the capacity benefits of CAVs.},

In this work, we develop methods to allow agents to dynamically adapt their behavior to their local conditions. We accomplish this by formulating the multi-agent navigation problem as an action-selection problem, and propose an approach, ALAN, that allows agents to compute time-efficient and collision-free motions. ALAN is highly scalable because each agent makes its own decisions on how to move using a set of velocities optimized for a variety of navigation tasks. Experimental results show that the agents using ALAN, in general, reach their destinations faster than using ORCA, a state-of-the-art collision avoidance framework, the Social Forces model for pedestrian navigation, and a Predictive collision avoidance model.},

abstract = {Self-driving vehicles are a maturing technology with the potential to reshape mobility by enhancing the safety, accessibility, efficiency, and convenience of automotive transportation. Safety-critical tasks that must be executed by a self-driving vehicle include planning of motions through a dynamic environment shared with other vehicles and pedestrians, and their robust executions via feedback control. The objective of this paper is to survey the current state of the art on planning and control algorithms with particular regard to the urban setting. A selection of proposed techniques is reviewed along with a discussion of their effectiveness. The surveyed approaches differ in the vehicle mobility model used, in assumptions on the structure of the environment, and in computational requirements. The side-by-side comparison presented in this survey helps to gain insight into the strengths and limitations of the reviewed approaches and assists with system level design choices.},

abstract = {Trajectory planning is an important component of autonomous driving. It takes the result of route-level navigation plan and generates the motion-level commands that steer an autonomous passenger vehicle (APV). Prior work on solving this problem uses either a sampling-based or optimization-based trajectory planner, accompanied by some high-level rule generation components. However, these schemes are limited in the following respects: 1. Sampling-based planners yield global resolution-complete optimal trajectories, but suffer from the curse of dimensionality and sampling sub-optimality (i.e., almost never reach a local optimum). Optimization-based planners can find a local optimal trajectory, but suffer from the unawareness of global optimum. 2. Both types of trajectory planner lack explicit tactical or behavior-level reasoning capability. They rely on the high-level behavioral decision-making component to make motion-level decisions that do not necessarily comply with the maneuver- ability of the planner and the APV. In this thesis, we adapt existing algorithms and propose new methods in the fields of optimal control (Chapter 3 {\&} 6), graph search (Chapter 4) and topological analysis (Chapter 5) to design an improved trajectory planning system. The core contributions of our work are summarized below: • A hybrid trajectory planner for on-road autonomous driving that maintains the key advantages of both the sampling-based and the optimization-based planners while reducing their limitations. • A novel type of edge-augmented graph that allows sampling-based planners to numerically approximate certain trajectory optimization methods. v • A novel backward induction method based on topological analysis to perform configuration-space segmentation over a direct acyclic graph (DAG) as an effi- cient way to explore the topological structure of a global configuration space. • A novel maneuver pattern distinction method based on trajectory sampling and topological analysis to distinguish region-based, topology-based and overtaking sequence-based patterns for motion-level tactical reasoning. • Adaptation of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller for model-feasible trajectory smoothing, and of the iterative-LQR (1st-order differential dynamic programming) for focused execution-feasible trajectory optimization. • Identification of useful principles and functions for constructing cost terms for trajectory evaluatio},

The Ariadne's clew algorithm comprises two sub-algorithms, called Search and Explore, applied in an interleaved manner. Explore builds a representation of the accessible space while Search looks for the target. Both are posed as optimization problems. We describe a real implementation of the algorithm to plan paths for a six degrees of freedom arm in a dynamic environment where another six degrees of freedom arm is used as a moving obstacle.

abstract = {Reservation-based intersection control is a revolutionary idea for using connected autonomous vehicle technologies to improve intersection controls. Vehicles individually request permission to follow precise paths through the intersection at specific times from an intersection manager agent. Previous studies have shown that reservations can reduce delays beyond optimized signals in many demand scenarios. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that signals can outperform reservations through theoretical and realistic examples. We present two examples that exploit the reservation protocol to prioritize vehicles on local roads over vehicles on arterials, increasing the total vehicle delay. A third theoretical example demonstrates that reservations can encourage selfish route choice leading to arbitrarily large queues. Next, we present two realistic networks taken from metropolitan planning organization data in which reservations perform worse than signals. We conclude with significantly positive results from comparing reservations and signals on the downtown Austin grid network using dynamic traffic assignment. Overall, these results indicate that network-based analyses are needed to detect adverse route choices before traffic signals can be replaced with reservation controls. In asymmetric intersections (e.g. local road-arterial intersections), reservation controls can cause several potential issues. However, in networks with more symmetric intersections such as a downtown grid, reservations have great potential to improve traffic.},

abstract = {Reservation-based intersection controls, in which vehicles reserve space-time paths through the intersection, have the potential to make greater use of intersection capacity than traffic signals. However, the efficiency of previous microsimulations of reservations has been severely limited by a protocol that requires vehicles to request reservations and the intersection manager to accept or reject them. We propose a new protocol, AIM∗, in which the intersection manager assigns reservations to vehicles, to greatly increase the optimization possibilities. Then, we present a mixed integer linear program for optimally choosing vehicle reservations under AIM∗. The formulation is similar to conflict resolution models for aviation, and ensures separation at all points that vehicles might intersect. We therefore present a rolling-horizon algorithm to extend the method to larger numbers of vehicles. Results show that the optimal reservation assignments from AIM∗ significantly reduce delays over previous protocols. Furthermore, the rolling horizon solutions have similar delays to a fixed horizon, thereby providing an efficient method of implementing AIM∗.},

Left turn through oncoming traffic is challenging for both human and automated vehicles because of a variety of time critical factors to consider. In particular, the position and speed of oncoming and crossing road users and the consideration of their existential, measurement and behavioral uncertainties influence the collision-free outcome of such a risky scenario. Highly automated, connected vehicles can help to reduce the number of accidents in inner-city intersection situations if these uncertainties are taken into account. We describe the integration of a model-predictive planning method, possibilities for modeling and calculating conflict areas based on geometric lane information, the calculation of conflict times based on behavioral predictions of observed road users and the interaction with the driver of the highly automated vehicle. The function is evaluated in field tests for the two EU funded projects Enable-S3 and UnCoVerCPS.},

abstract = {Although the picking of items may make up as much as 60{\%} of all labour activities in a warehouse and may account for as much as 65{\%} of all operating expenses, many order picking problems are still not well understood. Indeed, usually simple rules of thumb or straightforward constructive heuristics are used in practice, even in state-of-the-art warehouse management systems, however, it might well be that more attractive algorithmic alternatives could be developed. We addressed one such a fundamental materials handling problem: the batching of orders in a parallel-aisle warehouse so as to minimize the total traveling time neede to pick all items. Many heuristics have been proposed for this problem, however, a fundamental analysis of the problem is still lacking. In this paper, we first address the computational complexity of the problem. We prove that this problem is NP-hard in the strong sense but thaat it is solvable in polynomial time if no batch contains more than two orders. This result is not really surprising but t justifies the development of approximation and/or enumerative optimization algorithms for the general case. Our primary goal is to develop a branch-and-price optimization algorithm for the problem. To this end, we model the problem as a generalized set partitioning problem and present a column generation algorithm to solve its liear programming relaxation. Furthermore, we develop a new approximation algorithm for the problem. Finally, we test the performance of the branch-and-price algorithm and the approximation algorithm an a comprehensive set of instances. The computational experiments show the compelling performance of both algorithms.},

The first two approaches make use of the distributed computing based Networked Robotics architecture and communication framework of Robot Operating System (ROS) itself while the third approach uses Rapyuta Cloud Robotics framework for this implementation. The comparative performance of these approaches are analyzed through simulation as well as real world experiment with actual robots. These analyses provide an in-depth understanding of the inner working of the Cloud Robotics Platform in contrast to the usual ROS framework.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. While the robotics community agrees that the benchmarking is of high importance to objectively compare different solutions, there are only few and limited tools to support it. To address this issue in the context of multi-robot systems, we have defined a benchmarking process based on experimental designs, which aimed at improving the reproducibility of experiments by making explicit all elements of a benchmark such as parameters, measurements and metrics. We have also developed a ROS (Robot Operating System)-based testbed with the goal of making it easy for users to validate, benchmark, and compare different algorithms including coordination strategies. Our testbed uses the MORSE (Modular OpenRobots Simulation Engine) simulator for realistic simulation and a computer cluster for decentralized computation. In this paper, we present our testbed in details with the architecture and infrastructure, the issues encountered in implementing the infrastructure, and the automation of the deployment. We also report a series of experiments on multi-robot exploration, in order to demonstrate the capabilities of our testbed.},

Automatically guided vehicles capable of driving in a platoon fashion will represent an important feature of such systems. Platooning of a group of automated wheeled mobile robots relying on relative sensor information only is addressed in this paper. Each vehicle in the platoon must precisely follow the path of the vehicle in front of it and maintain the desired safety distance to that same vehicle. Vehicles have only distance and azimuth information to the preceding vehicle where no inter-vehicle communication is available. Following vehicles determine their reference positions and orientations based on estimated paths of the vehicles in front of them. Vehicles in the platoon are then controlled to follow the estimated trajectories. Then presented platooning control strategies are experimentally validated by experiments on a group of small-sized mobile robots and on a Pioneer 3AT mobile robot. The results and robustness analysis show the proposed platooning approach applicability.},

An effective means to increase the road throughput is to employ a small intervehicle time gap using automatic vehicle-following control systems. String stability, i.e., the disturbance attenuation along the vehicle string, is considered an essential requirement for the design of those systems. However, the formal notion of string stability is not unambiguous in literature, since both stability and performance interpretations exist. Therefore, a novel definition for string stability of nonlinear cascaded systems is proposed, using input-output properties. This definition is shown to result in well-known string stability conditions for linear cascaded systems. The theoretical results are experimentally validated using a platoon of six passenger vehicles equipped with cooperative adaptive cruise control. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

Note how the accelerations propagate from the intersection as a wave through the rest of the cars.

Abstract A traffic simulation combining ideas from the video game industry and from civil engineering is presented. Drivers with unique characteristics and preferences are generated and follow a randomly generated road map. Interesting behaviors are observed as selfish drivers force lane changes and move toward their goals, sending waves of decelerations backwards down the road to prevent collisions .},

abstract = {Macroscopic fundamental diagrams (MFD) of traffic for some networks have been shown to have similar shape to those for single links. They have erroneously been used to help estimate the level of travel in congested networks. We argue that supply curves, which track vehicles in their passage through congested networks, are needed for this purpose, and that they differ from the performance curves generated from MFD. We use a microsimulation model, DRACULA and two networks, one synthesizing the network for Cambridge, England, and one of the city of York, England, to explore the nature of performance curves and supply curves under differing patterns of demand. We show that supply curves differ from performance curves once the onset of congestion is reached, and that the incorrect use of performance curves to estimate demand can thus seriously underestimate traffic levels, the costs of congestion, and the value of congestion relief measures. We also show that network aggregated supply curves are sensitive to the temporal distribution of demand and, potentially, to the spatial distribution of demand. The shape of the supply curve also differs between origin-destination movements within a given network. We argue that supply curves for higher levels of demand cannot be observed in normal traffic conditions, and specify ways in which they can be determined from microsimulation and, potentially, by extrapolating observed data. We discuss the implications of these findings for conventional modelling of network management policies, and for these policies themselves. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

All road users need to be aware of the new rules. The rules also include a reference to the legislation that creates the offence.The official Highway Code reflects the most up-to-date legislation that road-users must adhere to, advice on road safety and best practice. The official Highway Code is for life, not just for learners. For over 75 years, the Highway Code has been the official guide to using the roads safely and legally. It has contributed enormously to road safety and reliable road transport.However, every day, on average around nine people are killed and around 80 are seriously injured in road collisions. So it is as important as ever that all road users, including drivers, motorcyclists, cyclists, horse riders and pedestrians, should update their knowledge of the Highway Code.The new edition (last major revision 1999) includes: 29 more rules than before; a new section on rules for users of powered wheelchairs and powered scooters; a safety code for new drivers, giving advice to help newly qualified drivers get through the first twelve months after passing the driving test, when they are most vulnerable, as safely as possible; new legislation that has been introduced on subjects such as vehicle emissions and smoking in vehicles that are workplaces; new stopping/directing powers that have been given to VOSA officers and Highways Agency Traffic Officers; new road initiatives of which people might not be aware (High occupancy vehicle lanes, Home Zones and Quiet Lanes, Active Traffic Management Schemes); more emphasis has been placed throughout the Code with regard to courtesy, attitude, awareness, and consideration of other road users, particularly those more vulnerable.},

Nevertheless, autonomous vehicles are still popular and attractive thanks to the improvement they represent to people's way of life (safer and quicker transit, more accessible, comfortable, convenient, efficient, and environment-friendly). This paper presents a review of motion planning techniques over the last decade with a focus on highway planning. In the context of this article, motion planning denotes path generation and decision making. Highway situations limit the problem to high speed and small curvature roads, with specific driver rules, under a constrained environment framework. Lane change, obstacle avoidance, car following, and merging are the situations addressed in this paper. After a brief introduction to the context of autonomous ground vehicles, the detailed conditions for motion planning are described. The main algorithms in motion planning, their features, and their applications to highway driving are reviewed, along with current and future challenges and open issues.},

abstract = {We present data from several German freeways showing different kinds of congested traffic forming near road inhomogeneities, specifically lane closings, intersections, or uphill gradients. The states are localized or extended, homogeneous or oscillating. Combined states are observed as well, like the coexistence of moving localized clusters and clusters pinned at road inhomogeneities, or regions of oscillating congested traffic upstream of nearly homogeneous congested traffic. The experimental findings are consistent with a recently proposed theoretical phase diagram for traffic near on-ramps [D. Helbing, A. Hennecke, and M. Treiber, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\{}$\backslash$bf 82{\}}, 4360 (1999)]. We simulate these situations with a novel continuous microscopic single-lane model, the ``intelligent driver model'' (IDM), using the empirical boundary conditions. All observations, including the coexistence of states, are qualitatively reproduced by describing inhomogeneities with local variations of one model parameter. We show that the results of the microscopic model can be understood by formulating the theoretical phase diagram for bottlenecks in a more general way. In particular, a local drop of the road capacity induced by parameter variations has practically the same effect as an on-ramp.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2000-2011 IEEE. Tile-based reservation intersection control for autonomous vehicles has the potential to reduce intersection delays beyond optimized traffic signals. A major question in implementing reservations is the underdetermined problem of resolving conflicting reservation requests. Previous work studied prioritizing requests by first come first served or holding auctions at intersections, but the possibilities are infinite. Furthermore, although selfish routing behavior could affect the benefits of the reservation prioritization, reservation control has not been studied with user equilibrium routing due to its microsimulation definition. This paper addresses these issues by presenting an integer program formulation of the conflict point simplification of reservations. The feasible region is transformed, resulting in a more tractable integer program on conflict regions for dynamic traffic assignment. Because the integer program is NP-hard we present a polynomial-Time heuristic. Finally, we demonstrate the potential utility of this heuristic by demonstrating objective functions that reduce travel time and energy consumption on a city network.},

Control actions are implicitly included in the optimized trajectory. Reliable navigation in dynamic environments is accomplished by augmenting the inner optimization loop with state feedback. The predictive control scheme is real-time capable and responds to obstacles within the robot's perceptual field. Navigation in large and complex environments is achieved in a pure pursuit fashion by requesting intermediate goals from a global planner. Requirements on the initial global path are fairly mild, compli- ance with the robot kinematics is not required.

The Dubins path generation is combined with a nonlinear Lypaunov-based path-following control. Finally we present a complete simulation environment in which the path generator and path following strategy are validated.

abstract = {Simple and efficient geometric controllers, like Pure-Pursuit, have been widely used in various types of autonomous vehicles to solve tracking problems. In this paper, we have developed a new pursuit method, named CF-Pursuit, which has been based on Pure-Pursuit but with certain differences. In CF-Pursuit, in order to reduce fitting errors, we used a clothoid C 1 curve to replace the circle employed in Pure-Pursuit. This improvement to the fitting method helps the Pursuit method to decrease tracking errors. As regards the selection of look-ahead distance, we employed a fuzzy system to directly consider the path's curvature. There are three input variables in this fuzzy system, 6mcurvature, 9mcurvature and 12mcurvature, calculated from the clothoid fit with the current position and the goal position on the defined path. A Sugeno fuzzy model was adapted to output a reasonable look-ahead distance using the experiences of human drivers as well as our own tests. Compared with some other geometric controllers, CF-Pursuit performs better in robustness, cross track errors and stability. The results from field tests have proven the CF-Pursuit is a practical and efficient geometric method for the path tracking problems of autonomous vehicles.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel technique for implementing Clothoidal real-time paths for mobile robots. As first step, Rational Bezier curves are obtained as approximation of the Fresnel integrals. By rescaling, rotating and translating the previously computed RBC, an on-line Clothoidal path is obtained. In this process, coefficients, weights and control points are kept invariant. This on-line approach guarantees that an RBC has the same behavior as the original Clothoid using a low curve order. The resulting Clothoidal path allows any two arbitrary poses to be joined in a plane. RBCs working as Clothoids are also used to search for the shortest bounded-curvature path with a significant computational cost reduction. In addition to this, the proposed technique is tested on a real mobile robot for trajectory generation and kinematic control. To the authors' knowledge, the present approach is the first technique which allows real-time Clothoidal path computation. {\textcopyright}2008 IEEE.},

This study presents an initial model for negotiation between an autonomous vehicle and another vehicle at an unsigned intersections or (equivalently) with a pedestrian at an unsigned road-crossing (jaywalking), using discrete sequential game theory. The model is intended as a basic framework for more realistic and data-driven future extensions. The model shows that when only vehicle position is used to signal intent, the optimal behaviors for both agents must include a non-zero probability of allowing a collision to occur. This suggests extensions to reduce this probability in future, such as other forms of signaling and control. Unlike most Game Theory applications in Economics, active vehicle control requires real-time selection from multiple equilibria with no history, and we present and argue for a novel solution concept, meta-strategy convergence, suited to this task.},

abstract = {The railway transition spiral here presented is a flexible easement curve of general applicability and of comparatively easy analysis. The conceptions and methods used are similar to those of ordinary circular railroad curves. The definition is based upon degree-of-curve, and degree-of-curve, central angle, and deflection angle may be calculated, and the curve may be located by transit and chain or by co-ordinates from tangent and circular curve. The field work is quite similar to that of circular curves. The spiral is easily applied to a variety of field problems and to a wide range of location and old track conditions. In the principal formulas, angles, co-ordinates, offsets, etc., are expressed in terms of the length or distance along the spiral. The use of series in the development of the properties permits an estimate of the error involved in discarding negligible terms The principal easement curves in use give alignments which approach each other very closely, so that, for equal easements, it may be expected that the riding qualities will not differ sensibly. In general, ease of calculation, simplicity of field work, and general applicability and flexibility will determine the form of easement curve to be selected. To establish the underlying principles of an easement curve of any range requires considerable mathematical analysis. The ordinary treatment of circular railway curves assumes previous knowledge of the geometrical properties of the circular curve, but the properties of the railway spiral must be deduced from the beginning. Fortunately the spiral is not complex, and its properties prove to be simple and general. A general treatment of such a curve i.as many advantages over approximate or special treatments. Approximate solutions may overlook important variables, and short methods may be limited to short and inefficient easements. The range of conditions of railway curves is so wide that it is best to develop methods of fairly general applicability, and these may then be simplified in meeting individual conditions. 380514 The treatment herein given has been quite widely used on the railroads of the United States and many engineers have commended its simplicity, convenience, and flexibility. The methods and principles are readily taken up by instrument men, and the field work has proved little more difficult than that for circular curves. The use of a regular rate of transition per 100 feet of spiral is advantageous, and the tables are in convenient form. The treatment of the railway transition spiral was published in Technograph No. 5, 1890-91, and was published in field-book size in 1899. Careful attention has been given in this revision to illustrative examples and explanations. The tables have been extended and a treatment of the Uniform Chord Length Method and of Street Railway Spirals added. For much of the latter, acknowledgment is made to Mr. A. L. Grandy. The writer is indebted to Messrs. J. K. Barker, Alfred L. Kuehn, and many others for valuable assistance in the preparation of tables and text.},

This paper aims to present a mathematical framework for the optimal design of AV zones in a general network. With the presence of AV zones, AVs may apply different routing principles outside of and within the AV zones. A novel network equilibrium model (we refer to it as the “mixed routing equilibrium model”) is thus firstly proposed to capture such mixed-routing behaviors. We then proceed to formulate a mixed-integer bi-level programming model to optimize the deployment plan of AV zones. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed models.},

We seek to determine minimally restrictive supervisors, which allow agents to choose all possible control actions that keep the system safe, that is, conflict free. This is achieved by determining the maximal controlled invariant set, and then by determining control actions that keep the system state inside this set. By exploiting the natural monotonicity of the agents dynamics along their paths, we translate this problem into an equivalent scheduling problem. This allows us to leverage existing results in the scheduling literature to obtain both exact and approximate solutions. The approximate algorithms have polynomial complexity and can handle large problems with guaranteed approximation bounds. We illustrate the application of the proposed algorithms through simulations in which vehicles crossing an intersection are overridden by the supervisor only when necessary to maintain safety},

Collision detection and avoidance are addressed based on an optimal strategy that uses collaboration between the vehicles. Lagrangian function is used to obtain closed-form solutions. This approach allows analysis of the collaboration process in terms of the cost and the time to resolve conflicts. Several approaches are used for weight assignments including reciprocal and unilateral actions. In this paper, reciprocal collaboration is defined as collaboration with equal costs. It is proven that the minimum cost to resolve any conflict corresponds to equal weights but not to reciprocal collaboration. On the other hand, reciprocal collaboration results in the minimum time to resolve a conflict. The proposed methods present effective solutions to the problem.

The two levels are coupled by the arrival time and terminal speed. By using the relationship between the safe time headway and the process time, a novel platoon-based method is developed to reduce the computational burden.

abstract = {With an increasing number of vehicles equipped with adaptive cruise control (ACC), the impact of such vehicles on the collective dynamics of traffic flow becomes relevant. By means of simulation, we investigate the influence of variable percentages of ACC vehicles on traffic flow characteristics. For simulating the ACC vehicles, we propose a new car-following model that also serves as basis of an ACC implementation in real cars. The model is based on the Intelligent Driver Model [Treiber et al., Physical Review E 62, 1805 (2000)] and inherits its intuitive behavioural parameters: desired velocity, acceleration, comfortable deceleration, and desired minimum time headway. It eliminates, however, the sometimes unrealistic behaviour of the Intelligent Driver Model in cut-in situations with ensuing small gaps that regularly are caused by lane changes of other vehicles in dense or congested traffic. We simulate the influence of different ACC strategies on the maximum capacity before breakdown, and the (dynamic) bottleneck capacity after breakdown. With a suitable strategy, we find sensitivities of the order of 0.3, i.e., 1{\%} more ACC vehicles will lead to an increase of the capacities by about 0.3{\%}. This sensitivity multiplies when considering travel times at actual breakdowns.},

abstract = {Boss is an autonomous vehicle that uses on-board sensors (global positioning system, lasers, radars, and cameras) to track other vehicles, detect static obstacles, and localize itself relative to a road model. A three-layer planning system combines mission, behavioral, and motion planning to drive in urban environments. The mission planning layer considers which street to take to achieve a mission goal. The behavioral layer determines when to change lanes and precedence at intersections and performs error recovery maneuvers. The motion planning layer selects actions to avoid obstacles while making progress toward local goals. The system was developed from the ground up to address the requirements of the DARPA Urban Challenge using a spiral system development process with a heavy emphasis on regular, regressive system testing. During the National Qualification Event and the 85-km Urban Challenge Final Event, Boss demonstrated some of its capabilities, qualifying first and winning the challenge.},

abstract = {Rapidly exploring randomised trees (RRTs) are a useful tool generating maps for use by agents to navigate. A disadvantage to using RRTs is the length of time required to generate the map. In large scale environments, or those with narrow corridors, the time needed to create the map can be prohibitive. This paper explores a new method for improving the generation of RRTs in large scale environments. We look at using trails as a new source of information for the agent's map building process. Trails are a set of observations of how other agents, human or AI, have navigated an environment. We evaluate RRT performance in two types of virtual environment, the first generated to cover a variety of scenarios an agent may face when building maps, the second is a set of `real' virtual environments based in Second Life. By including trails we can improve the RRT generation step in most environments, allowing the RRT to be used to successfully plan routes using fewer points and reducing the length of the overall route.},

@article{Fischer1974,
abstract = {We consider a common variant of the vehicle routing problem in which a vehicle fleet delivers products stored at a central depot to satisfy customer orders. Each vehicle has a fixed capacity, and each order uses a fixed portion of vehicle capacity. The routing decision involves deter- mining which of the demands will be satisfied by each vehicle and what route each vehicle will follow in servicing its assigned demand in order to minimize total delivery cost. We present a heuristic for this problem in which an assignment of customers to vehicles is obtained by solving a generalized assignment problem with an objective function that approximates delivery cost. This heuristic has many attractive features. It has outperformed the best existing heuristics on a sample of standard test problems. It will always find a feasible solution if one exists, something no other existing heuristic can guarantee. It can be easily adapted tc accommodate many additional problem complexities. By parametrically varying the number of vehicles in the fleet, our method can be used to optimally solve the problem of finding the minimum size fleet that can feasibly service the specified demand},

abstract = {The introduction of connected and autonomous vehicles will bring changes to the highway driving environment. Connected vehicle technology provides real-time information about the surrounding traffic condition and the traffic management center's decisions. Such information is expected to improve drivers' efficiency, response, and comfort while enhancing safety and mobility. Connected vehicle technology can also further increase efficiency and reliability of autonomous vehicles, though these vehicles could be operated solely with their on-board sensors, without communication. While several studies have examined the possible effects of connected and autonomous vehicles on the driving environment, most of the modeling approaches in the literature do not distinguish between connectivity and automation, leaving many questions unanswered regarding the implications of different contemplated deployment scenarios. There is need for a comprehensive acceleration framework that distinguishes between these two technologies while modeling the new connected environment. This study presents a framework that utilizes different models with technology-appropriate assumptions to simulate different vehicle types with distinct communication capabilities. The stability analysis of the resulting traffic stream behavior using this framework is presented for different market penetration rates of connected and autonomous vehicles. The analysis reveals that connected and autonomous vehicles can improve string stability. Moreover, automation is found to be more effective in preventing shockwave formation and propagation under the model's assumptions. In addition to stability, the effects of these technologies on throughput are explored, suggesting substantial potential throughput increases under certain penetration scenarios.},

abstract = {The development of automated and coordinated driving systems (platooning) is an hot topic today for vehicles and it represents a challenging scenario that heavily relies on distributed control in the presence of wireless communication network. To actuate platooning in a safe way it is necessary to design controllers able to effectively operate on informations exchanged via Inter-Vehicular Communication (IVC) systems despite the presence of unavoidable communication impairments, such as multiple time-varying delays that affect communication links. To this aim in this paper we propose a novel distributed adaptive collaborative control strategy that exploits information coming from connected vehicles to achieve leader synchronization and we analytically demonstrate its stability with a Lyapunov-Krasovskii approach. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is shown via numerical simulations in PLEXE, a state of the art IVC and mobility simulator that includes basic building blocks for platooning.},

abstract = {Today, robotic systems are bridging the gaps between global economy, social needs, and logistics focusing on sustainable development solutions. Everyday new robotic applications can be found in literature and media. Some of them are basically entertainment toys. Nevertheless, the great majority of them is used inside industries, performing several tasks (painting, welding, moving materials, etc.). In a scenario of global economy growth, any sustainable solution that can reduce the product final cost is welcome. This article presents researches on robotic forklifts for intelligent warehouses developed at the Mechatronics Lab at USP-EESC in Brazil. We show three key-routines that determine the Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) behavior: the routing algorithm (that computes the overall task execution time and the minimum global path of each AGV using a topological map of the warehouse), the local path planning algorithm (based on A* it searches for the local minimum path between two nodes of the warehouse topological map), and an auto-localization algorithm (that applies an Extended Kalman Filter - EKF - to estimate the AGVs actual positions). In order to validate the algorithms developed, several tests were carried out using the simulation software Player/Stage. The results obtained were encouraging and the router developed was able to solve traffic jams and collisions, before sending the final paths to the robots. In a near future all algorithms will be implemented using mini- robotic forklifts and a scaled environment built in our lab.},

In fact, local sensing capabilities are complemented with global information, thus extending the field of view of each AGV.

In this paper, we present our software framework Fawkes which follows the component-based software design paradigm by featuring a clear component concept with well-defined communication interfaces. We deployed Fawkes on several different robot platforms ranging from service robots to biped soccer robots. Following the component concept with clearly defined communication interfaces shows great benefit when porting robot software from one robot to the other. Fawkes comes with a number of useful plugins for tasks like timing, logging, data visualization, software configuration, and even high-level decision making. These make it particularly easy to create and to debug productive code, shortening the typical development cycle for robot software.},

abstract = {We address a bilevel decomposition algorithm for solving the simultaneous scheduling and conflict-free routing problems for automated guided vehicles. The overall objective is to minimize the total weighted tardiness of the set of jobs related to these tasks. A mixed integer formulation is decomposed into two levels: the upper level master problem of task assignment and scheduling; and the lower level routing subproblem. The master problem is solved by using Lagrangian relaxation and a lower bound is obtained. Either the solution turns out to be feasible for the lower level or a feasible solution for the problem is constructed, and an upper bound is obtained. If the convergence is not satisfied, cuts are generated to exclude previous feasible solutions before solving the master problem again. Two types of cuts are proposed to reduce the duality gap. The effectiveness of the proposed method is investigated from computational experiments. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Further, adjacent clothoid segments can be locally blended to result in a G3curve with curvature that predominantly varies linearly with arc length. We also handle intended sharp corners or G1discontinuities, as independent rotations of clothoid pieces. Our formulation is ideally suited to conceptual design applications where aesthetic fairness of the sketched curve takes precedence over the precise interpolation of geometric constraints.

An NMPC algorithm predicts the behavior of a system over a receding time horizon, and the NMPC generates the optimal control commands for the horizon. The first input command is, then, applied to the system and this procedure repeats at each time step. The input constraint and state constraint for formation flight and inter-collision avoidance are considered in the proposed NMPC framework. The performance of NMPC for formation guidance critically degrades when there exists a communication failure. In order to address this problem, the modified optimal guidance law using only lineof-sight, relative distance, and own motion information is presented. If this information can be measured or estimated, the proposed formation guidance is sustainable with the communication failure.

They represent the main trend in future intelligent transportation systems. This paper concentrates on the planning problem of autonomous vehicles in traffic. We model the interaction between the autonomous vehicle and the environment as a stochastic Markov decision process (MDP) and consider the driving style of an expert driver as the target to be learned. The road geometry is taken into consideration in the MDP model in order to incorporate more diverse driving styles. The desired, expert-like driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle is obtained as follows: First, we design the reward function of the corresponding MDP and determine the optimal driving strategy for the autonomous vehicle using reinforcement learning techniques. Second, we collect a number of demonstrations from an expert driver and learn the optimal driving strategy based on data using inverse reinforcement learning. The unknown reward function of the expert driver is approximated using a deep neural-network (DNN). We clarify and validate the application of the maximum entropy principle (MEP) to learn the DNN reward function, and provide the necessary derivations for using the maximum entropy principle to learn a parameterized feature (reward) function. Simulated results demonstrate the desired driving behaviors of an autonomous vehicle using both the reinforcement learning and inverse reinforcement learning techniques.},

In this work, we design a convex optimization based AIC mechanism. In particular, we design the metric of smoothness with the objective of quantitatively capturing the quality of travel experience and transform the objective into a convex function. In addition, we linearize colli- sion avoidance constraints by designing a schedule rule, which determines the priority of vehicles when passing through the intersection according to the travel time of individual vehicles. On this basis, we propose a new algorithm to achieve the optimal solution with low overhead. Finally, we build the simulation model and implement the algorithm for performance evaluation.

abstract = {Connected and autonomous vehicle technology has advanced rapidly in recent years. These technologies create possibil- ities for highly efficient, AI-based, transportation systems. One such system is the Autonomous Intersection Manage- ment (AIM), an intersection management protocol designed for the time when all vehicles are fully autonomous and con- nected. Experts, however, anticipate a long transition pe- riod during which human and autonomously operated ve- hicles will coexist. Unfortunately, AIM has been shown to provide little or no improvement over today's traffic signals when less than 90{\%} of the vehicles are autonomous, making AIM ineffective for a large portion of the transition period. This paper introduces a new protocol denoted Hybrid Au- tonomous Intersection Management (H-AIM), that is appli- cable as long as AIM is applicable and the infrastructure is able to sense approaching vehicles. Our experiments show that this protocol can decrease traffic delay for autonomous vehicles even at 1{\%} technology penetration rate. CCS},

@article{Kala2013,
abstract = {Planning is one of the key problems for autonomous vehicles operating in road scenarios. Present planning algorithms operate with the assumption that traffic is organised in predefined speed lanes, which makes it impossible to allow autonomous vehicles in countries with unorganised traffic. Unorganised traffic is though capable of higher traffic bandwidths when constituting vehicles vary in their speed capabilities and sizes. Diverse vehicles in an unorganised exhibit unique driving behaviours which are analysed in this paper by a simulation study. The aim of the work reported here is to create a planning algorithm for mixed traffic consisting of both autonomous and non-autonomous vehicles without any inter-vehicle communication. The awareness (e.g. vision) of every vehicle is restricted to nearby vehicles only and a straight infinite road is assumed for decision making regarding navigation in the presence of multiple vehicles. Exhibited behaviours include obstacle avoidance, overtaking, giving way for vehicles to overtake from behind, vehicle following, adjusting the lateral lane position and so on. A conflict of plans is a major issue which will almost certainly arise in the absence of inter-vehicle communication. Hence each vehicle needs to continuously track other vehicles and rectify plans whenever a collision seems likely. Further it is observed here that driver aggression plays a vital role in overall traffic dynamics, hence this has also been factored in accordingly. This work is hence a step forward towards achieving autonomous vehicles in unorganised traffic, while similar effort would be required for planning problems such as intersections, mergers, diversions and other modules like localisation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The acceleration and braking profiles of several public transportation vehicles were investigated as part of an independent undergraduate student research project in Electro-Mechanical Engineering Technology. In particular, vehicles in which the passengers are often required to stand while the vehicle is moving were studied. These vehicles include city buses and subway trains. Vehicle acceleration, either positive or negative (braking), and the time rate of change of acceleration, jerk, can have a significant impact on the safety and comfort of passengers. The effects of acceleration and jerk are especially troublesome for passengers that either choose to stand or must stand in the vehicle because no empty seats are available. A standing passenger has a higher center of mass and smaller base footprint than one that is seated. The standing position is also less stable than the seated position. Therefore as the vehicle accelerates or changes its acceleration, standing passengers must exert significant forces with their limbs to maintain their balance. In this paper, the instrumentation and software used to measure the acceleration and jerk of some public transportation vehicles are presented and discussed. Instrumentation hardware and software typically used in an engineering technology laboratory was used for these measurements. The data obtained from the testing of several vehicles is analyzed and interpreted using software and techniques familiar to undergraduate engineering technology students. Fundamental dynamics associated with the human passengers is also presented and discussed. Careful control of the acceleration and braking profile of the vehicle can greatly improve the comfort and safety of the passengers. A suggested instrumentation and display system to help drivers control the acceleration profiles to improve passenger safety is presented. This project utilizes many aspects of the course and laboratory work of the four-year electro-mechanical engineering technology program.

@article{Beard2014,
abstract = {The combination of low-frequency lateral and roll motions experienced in tilting trains can provoke motion sickness. The incidence of sickness depends on vehicle design and subject demographics. Vehicle design affects the location of the centre-of-roll, which influences passenger perception of motion. Age and gender have large influences on susceptibility to sickness, but little is known about the effects of ethnicity and body size. This study investigated the influence of both the vertical position of the centre-of-roll and subject characteristics (ethnicity, weight, stature and sickness susceptibility) on sickness caused by fully roll-compensated lateral oscillation. It was hypothesised that sickness would be greater when full compensation occurred at the head than when full compensation occurred at the seat. Sixty subjects experienced a 0.2-Hz lateral oscillation combined with {\{}+/-{\}}7.3{\{}degrees{\}} of roll, so that the lateral acceleration was fully compensated at either the seat surface or 800 mm above the seat (i.e. average head height). Illness ratings and symptom scores were recorded every minute for 50 min (i.e. during a 5-min acclimatisation period, a 30-min exposure period and a 15-min recovery period). Although the mean illness ratings were greater when full compensation occurred at the head than at the seat, the difference was not statistically significant. Weight and stature were not associated with motion sickness, but illness ratings were much greater in Asian subjects than in European subjects. It is concluded that differences in susceptibility between Asians and Europeans have a greater effect on motion sickness than the height of the centre-of-rotation during roll-compensated lateral acceleration.},

This property makes it very useful as a transition curve when designing the layout of roads and railway tracks. This paper presents an analysis of two methods for computing the clothoid: the classical method, which is based on the use of explicit formulas obtained from Taylor expansions of sine and cosine functions, and an alternative algorithm, which is based on the numerical solution of the initial value problems giving the clothoid parametrization. This alternative method is simple and efficient, and its effectiveness is shown through its application to three classical problems of horizontal road alignment.},

Team VictorTango is acutely aware of this opportunity; our goal is to develop an autonomous vehicle system that will revolutionize unmanned systems. Our commitment to excellence begins with our vehicle platform, Odin, a 2005 Ford Escape Hybrid. Sensors, computers, power systems, and control elements have been integrated into Odin, resulting in an autonomous platform providing an extraordinary combination of safety, reliability, and ease of operation. Extensive effort has gone into the selection and location of sensors and into the development of algorithms and software. Data from multiple sensors is fused to perceive road coverage and to detect and differentiate static obstacles from vehicles. Where possible, we have relied on proven navigation approaches, but we have also developed revolutionary new approaches to ensure a successful progression from Basic Navigation through Advanced Traffic requirements. Important innovations include the development of novel software architectures, the creation of a custom Urban Challenge simulator, and total commitment to JAUS to enable cross-platform compatibility. Most importantly, the work of team VictorTango is bringing software out of simulation and into the field.},

The contributions of this paper are fourfold. First, we present a trajectory planning framework that is able to handle geometry constraints, nonholonomic constraints, and dynamics constraints of cars in a humanlike and layered fashion and generate curvature-continuous, kinodynamically feasible, smooth, and collision-free trajectories in real time. Second, we present a derivative-free global path modification algorithm to extract high-order state information in free space for state sampling. Third, we extend the regular state-space sampling method widely used in on-road autonomous driving systems to a multi-phase deterministic state-space sampling method that is able to approximate complex maneuvers. Fourth, we improve collision checking accuracy and efficiency by using a different car footprint approximation strategy and a two-phase collision checking routine. A range of challenging simulation experiments show that the proposed method returns high-quality trajectories in real time and outperforms existing planners, such as hybrid A* and conjugate-gradient descent path smoother in terms of path quality, efficiency, and computation resources used.},

abstract = {To investigate the role of nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) in beta1-integrin- mediated adhesion and signaling, we transfected mouse L cells with normal and catalytically inactive forms of the phosphatase. Parental cells and cells expressing the wild-type or mutant PTP1B were assayed for (a) adhesion, (b) spreading, (c) presence of focal adhesions and stress fibers, and (d) tyrosine phosphorylation. Parental cells and cells expressing wild-type PTP1B show similar morphology, are able to attach and spread on fibronectin, and form focal adhesions and stress fibers. In contrast, cells expressing the inactive PTP1B have a spindle-shaped morphology, reduced adhesion and spreading on fibronectin, and almost a complete absence of focal adhesions and stress fibers. Attachment to fibronectin induces tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin in parental cells and cells transfected with the wild-type PTP1B, while in cells transfected with the mutant PTP1B, such induction is not observed. Additionally, in cells expressing the mutant PTP1B, tyrosine phosphorylation of Src is enhanced and activity is reduced. Lysophosphatidic acid temporarily reverses the effects of the mutant PTP1B, suggesting the existence of a signaling pathway triggering focal adhesion assembly that bypasses the need for active PTP1B. PTP1B coimmunoprecipitates with beta1-integrin from nonionic detergent extracts and colocalizes with vinculin and the ends of actin stress fibers in focal adhesions. Our data suggest that PTP1B is a critical regulatory component of integrin signaling pathways, which is essential for adhesion, spreading, and formation of focal adhesions.},

abstract = {Provably correct and computationally efficient path planning in the presence of various constraints is essential for autonomous driving and agile maneuvering of mobile robots. In this paper, we consider the planning of G 3 -continuous planar paths with continuous and limited curvature in a motion environment that is bounded and contains obstacles modeled by a set of (non-convex) polygons. In practice, the curvature constraints often arise from mechanical limitations for the robot, such as limited steering and articulation angles in wheeled robots, or aerodynamic constraints in unmanned aerial vehicles. To solve the planning problem under those stringent constraints, we improve upon known path primitives, such as Reeds–Shepp (RS) and CC-steer (curvature-continuous) paths. Given the initial and final robot configuration, we developed extend-procedure computing paths that can approximate RS paths with arbitrary precision, but guaranteeing G 3 -continuity. We show that satisfaction of all stated path constraints is guaranteed and, contrary to many other methods known from the literature, the method of checking for collisions between the planned path and obstacles is given by a closed-form analytic expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach is not conservative, i.e., it allows for precise maneuvers in tight environments under the assumption of a rectangular robot footprint. The presented extend procedure can be integrated into various motion-planning algorithms available in the literature. In particular, we utilized the Rapidly exploring Random Trees (RRT*) algorithm in conjunction with our extend procedure to demonstrate its feasibility in motion environments of nontrivial complexity and low computational cost in comparison to a G 3 -continuous extend procedure based on $\eta$ 3 -splines.},

The algorithm alternates between two convex optimizations: (1) a quadratic program that generates a set of hyperplanes to separate a convex region of space from the set of obstacles and (2) a semidefinite program that finds a maximum-volume ellipsoid inside the polytope intersection of the obstacle- free half-spaces defined by those hyperplanes. Both the hyperplanes and the ellip- soid are refined over several iterations to monotonically increase the volume of the inscribed ellipsoid, resulting in a large polytope and ellipsoid of obstacle-free space. Practical applications of the algorithm are presented in 2D and 3D, and extensions to N-dimensional configuration spaces are discussed. Experiments demonstrate that the algorithm has a computation time which is linear in the number of obstacles, and our matlab [18] implementation converges in seconds for environments with millions of obstacles.},

Each aircraft plans its trajectory individually using a receding horizon strategy based on mixed integer linear programming (MILP). A con- strained, inertial, first-order linear model is used to capture the dynamics and kinematics of the vehicle. Safety is guaranteed by maintaining, at each time step, a dynamically feasible trajectory for each aircraft that terminates in a loiter pattern. Conflicts between multiple aircraft are resolved in a sequential, decentralized fashion, in which each aircraft takes into account the latest trajectory and loiter pattern of the other aircraft. Besides maintaining feasibility, if the problem is too complex to be solved within the time constraints of a real- time system, this approach also provides an a priori safe rescue solution consisting of the previous trajectories and individual loiter patterns. Several examples of conflict situations resolved by the proposed method are presented.},

abstract = {Automated planning and reinforcement learning are characterized by complementary views on decision making: the former relies on previous knowledge and computation, while the latter on interaction with the world, and experience. Planning allows robots to carry out different tasks in the same domain, without the need to acquire knowledge about each one of them, but relies strongly on the accuracy of the model. Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, does not require previous knowledge, and allows robots to robustly adapt to the environment, but often necessitates an infeasible amount of experience. We present Domain Approximation for Reinforcement LearnING (DARLING), a method that takes advantage of planning to constrain the behavior of the agent to reasonable choices, and of reinforcement learning to adapt to the environment, and increase the reliability of the decision making process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on a service robot, carrying out a variety of tasks in an office building. We find that when the robot makes decisions by planning alone on a given model it often fails, and when it makes decisions by reinforcement learning alone it often cannot complete its tasks in a reasonable amount of time. When employing DARLING, even when seeded with the same model that was used for planning alone, however, the robot can quickly learn a behavior to carry out all the tasks, improves over time, and adapts to the environment as it changes.},

The main reason for autonomous driving in the framework of the three-phase theory is that an autonomous driving vehicle should learn from driver behaviors in real traffic found in empirical data and explained in the three-phase theory. In contrast with the classical approach to autonomous driving in which at each given speed the vehicle tries to reach a fixed desired time headway, in the autonomous driving strategy based on the three-phase traffic theory there is no fixed time headway to the preceding vehicle.},

In this paper, an approach based on application scenarios is put forward for facilitating dynamic adaptations of decentralized software systems in unpredicted situations. Scenarios offer behavior norms to regulate the behavior of autonomous software entities under specific situations so that software entities can take fitted and coordinative actions when they are confronted with diverse and even unpredicted situations. At the end of this paper, a simulation traffic system is developed and studied. The experimental results show that the adaptability of the system is improved remarkably after application scenarios are deployed. In the case study, the efficiency and scalability of the scenario-based adaptation mechanism are also experimented and analyzed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Ramrez2005,
abstract = {Combining the principles of dynamic inversion and optimisation theory, two stabilising state-feedback control design approaches are presented for a class of nonlinear distributed par-ameter systems. One approach combines the dynamic inversion with variational optimisation theory and it can be applied when there is a continuous actuator in the spatial domain. This approach has more theoretical significance in the sense that it does not lead to any singularity in the control computation and the convergence of the control action can be proved. The other approach, which can be applied when there are a number of discrete actuators located at distinct places in the spatial domain, combines dynamic inversion with static optimisation theory. This approach has more relevance in practice, since such a scenario appears naturally in many practical problems because of implementation concern. These new techniques can be classified as 'design-then-approximate' techniques, which are in general more elegant than the 'approximate-then-design' techniques. However, unlike the existing design-then-approximate techniques, the new techniques presented here do not demand involved mathematics (like infinite-dimensional operator theory, inertial manifold theory and so on). To demonstrate the potential of the proposed techniques, a real-life temperature control problem for a heat transfer application is solved, first assuming a continuous actuator and then assuming a set of discrete actuators. 1 Introduction There are wide class of problems (e.g. heat transfer, fluid flow, flexible structures and so on) for which a lumped par-ameter modelling is inadequate and a distributed parameter system (DPS) approach is necessary. In contrast to lumped parameter systems, which are governed by ordinary differ-ential equations (ODEs), distributed parameter systems are governed by a set of coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) in general. Control design for distributed parameter systems is often more challenging when compared with lumped parameter systems. Control of DPSs has been studied both from math-ematical as well as engineering point of view. An interest-ing brief historical perspective of the control of such systems is found in [1]. In a broad sense, existing control design techniques for distributed parameter systems can be attributed to either 'approximate-then-design (ATD)' or 'design-then-approximate (DTA)' categories. An inter-ested reader can refer to [2] for discussions on the relative merits and limitations of the two approaches. In the ATD approach, the idea is to first design a low-dimensional reduced (truncated) model, which retains the dominant modes of the system. This truncated model (which is often a finite-dimensional lumped parameter model) is then used to design the control action. One such potential approach, which has become fairly popular, first comes up with problem-oriented basis functions using the idea of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) (through the 'snap-shot solutions') and then uses those in a Galerkin procedure to arrive at a low-dimensional reduced lumped parameter approximate model (which usually turns out to be a fairly good approximation). Out of numer-ous literatures published on this topic and its use in control system design, we cite [3– 11] for reference. For linear systems, such an approach of designing the POD-based basis function leads to the optimal representation of the PDE system in the sense that it captures the maximum energy of the system with least number of basis functions when compared with any other set of orthogonal basis func-tions [8]. For nonlinear systems, however, such a useful result does not exist. Even though the POD-based model reduction idea has been successfully used for numerous linear and nonlinear DPS in both linear as well as nonlinear problems, there are a few important shortcomings, which include (i) the technique is problem-dependent and not generic; (ii) there is no guarantee that the snap-shot solutions will capture all dominant modes of the system and; most important, (iii) it is usually difficult to have a set of 'good' snap-shot solutions for the closed-loop system prior to the control design. This is a serious limiting factor for applying this technique in the closed-loop control design. Because of this reason, some attempts are being made in recent litera-ture to adaptively redesign the basis functions (and hence the control action) in an iterative manner. An interested reader can see [3, 4, 10] for a few ideas in this regard. An interesting ATD approach has appeared in [12], where the authors have proposed an innovative model},

The underlying coordination framework uses arti cial potentials and virtual leaders. Symmetry in the framework is exploited to partially decouple the mission control problem into a formation management subproblem and a maneuver management subproblem. The designed dynamics of the virtual leaders play a key role in both subproblems: the direction of motion of the virtual leaders is designed to satisfy the mission while the speed of the virtual leaders is designed to ensure stability and convergence properties of the formation. The latter is guaranteed by regulating the virtual leader speed according to a feedback measurement of an appropriate formation error function. The coordination strategy is illustrated in the context of adaptive gradient climbing missions.},

Two strategies are considered: all lights in phase and a "green wave" with a propagating green signal. It is found that the mean velocity near the resonant condition follows a critical scaling law. For the green wave, it is shown that the mean velocity scaling law holds even for random separation between traffic lights and is not dependent on the density. This independence on car density is broken when random perturbations are considered in the car velocity. Random velocity perturbations also have the effect of leading the system to an emergent state, where cars move in clusters, but with an average velocity which is independent of traffic light switching for large injection rates.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical path planning approach for mobile robot navigation in complex environments. The proposed approach has a two-level structure. In the first level, the A⁎ algorithm based on grids is used to find a geometric path quickly and several path points are selected as subgoals for the next level. In the second level, an approximate policy iteration algorithm called least-squares policy iteration (LSPI) is used to learn a near-optimal local planning policy that can generate smooth trajectories under kinematic constraints of the robot. Using this near-optimal local planning policy, the mobile robot can find an optimized path by sequentially approaching the subgoals obtained in the first level. One advantage of the proposed approach is that the kinematic characteristics of the mobile robot can be incorporated into the LSPI-based path optimization procedure. The second advantage is that the LSPI-based local path optimizer uses an approximate policy iteration algorithm which has been proven to be data-efficient and stable. The training of the local path optimizer can use sample experiences collected randomly from any reasonable sampling distribution. Furthermore, the LSPI-based local path optimizer has the ability of dealing with uncertainties in the environment. For unknown obstacles, it just needs to replan the path in the second level rather than the whole planner. Simulations for path planning in various types of environments have been carried out and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Cooperative methods, including time slots and space reservation, trajectory planning, and virtual traffic lights, are discussed in detail. Vehicle collision warning and avoidance methods are discussed to deal with uncertainties. Concerning vulnerable road users, pedestrian collision avoidance methods are discussed. In addition, an introduction to major projects related to cooperative intersection management is presented. A further discussion of the presented works is given with highlights of future research topics.

It is described how human interaction is a constant and important intrinsic property of city driving, and how these interactions can lead to explicit phenomena. A framework is presented for the further analysis of congestion at three spatial levels, and the driver behaviours that may be of most significance at each described. Building on this model, the paper presents a case study carried out at the highly congested Blackwall Tunnel in London. In providing evidence for some of the concepts described in this paper, the case study demonstrates how human behaviour causes the emergence of road congestion.

Agile vehicle dynamics are captured through a hybrid control architecture that combines several linear time-invariant modes with a discrete set of agile maneuvers. The latter are represented by affine transformations in the state space and can be described using a limited number of parameters. We specialize the approach to the case of a small-scale helicopter flying through an urban environment. Next, we introduce the concept of terminal feasible invariant sets in which a vehicle can remain for an indefinite period of time without colliding with obstacles or other vehicles. These sets are formulated as affine constraints on the last state of the planning horizon and as such are computed online. They guarantee feasibility of the receding horizon optimization at future time steps by providing an a priori known backup plan that is dynamically feasible and obstacle-free.},

A driving simulator study with N = 28 drivers in a dense traffic scenario on the highway was conducted. It was assumed that different lag vehicle reaction behavior on turn signals of the ego driver would influence the ego driver in his subjective evaluation of the situation. Three main effects, deceleration, the amount of velocity reduction and reaction time concerning perceived cooperation were found. The results of the study can be used to design cooperative driving strategies between self-driving and manually driven vehicles.},

Young novice drivers and especially young male drivers showed more problems connected to the higher hierarchical levels of driving behaviour than middle-aged novice drivers. The number of accidents and offences was highest among the young males and their accidents took place more often at night than female or older drivers' accidents. Female drivers showed more problems connected to the lower hierarchical levels of driving behaviour, e.g. problems in vehicle handling skills.

abstract = {Recent advances in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have led to the development of DNN-driven autonomous cars that, using sensors like camera, LiDAR, etc., can drive without any human intervention. Most major manufacturers including Tesla, GM, Ford, BMW, and Waymo/Google are working on building and testing different types of autonomous vehicles. The lawmakers of several US states including California, Texas, and New York have passed new legislation to fast-track the process of testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles on their roads. However, despite their spectacular progress, DNNs, just like traditional software, often demonstrate incorrect or unexpected corner case behaviors that can lead to potentially fatal collisions. Several such real-world accidents involving autonomous cars have already happened including one which resulted in a fatality. Most existing testing techniques for DNN-driven vehicles are heavily dependent on the manual collection of test data under different driving conditions which become prohibitively expensive as the number of test conditions increases. In this paper, we design, implement and evaluate DeepTest, a systematic testing tool for automatically detecting erroneous behaviors of DNN-driven vehicles that can potentially lead to fatal crashes. First, our tool is designed to automatically generated test cases leveraging real-world changes in driving conditions like rain, fog, lighting conditions, etc. DeepTest systematically explores different parts of the DNN logic by generating test inputs that maximize the numbers of activated neurons. DeepTest found thousands of erroneous behaviors under different realistic driving conditions (e.g., blurring, rain, fog, etc.) many of which lead to potentially fatal crashes in three top performing DNNs in the Udacity self-driving car challenge.},

Safety-critical tasks that must be executed by a self-driving vehicle include planning of motions through a dynamic environment shared with other vehicles and pedestrians, and their robust executions via feedback control. The objective of this paper is to survey the current state of the art on planning and control algorithms with particular regard to the urban setting. A selection of proposed techniques is reviewed along with a discussion of their effectiveness. The surveyed approaches differ in the vehicle mobility model used, in assumptions on the structure of the environment, and in computational requirements. The side-by-side comparison presented in this survey helps to gain insight into the strengths and limitations of the reviewed approaches and assists with system level design choices.},

The proposed path planning method determines not only an optimal path, but also the appropriate acceleration and speed for a vehicle. In this method, we first construct a center line from a set of predefined waypoints, which are usually obtained from a lane-level map. A series of path candidates are generated by the arc length and offset to the center line in the s-$\rho$ coordinate system. Then, all of these candidates are converted into Cartesian coordinates. The optimal path is selected considering the total cost of static safety, comfortability, and dynamic safety; meanwhile, the appropriate acceleration and speed for the optimal path are also identified. Various types of roads, including single-lane roads and multi-lane roads with static and moving obstacles, are designed to test the proposed method. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and indicate its wide practical application to autonomous driving.},

We propose an ensemble approach based on a two layer control architecture and on an automatic algorithm for the definition of the roadmap. The roadmap is built by considering the path planning algorithm implemented on the hierarchical architecture and vice versa. In this way, we want to manage the coordination of the whole system in order to increase the flexibility and the global efficiency. Furthermore, the roadmap is computed in order to maximize the redundancy, the coverage and the connectivity. The architecture is composed of two layers. The low-level represents the roadmap itself. The high-level describes the topological relationship among different areas of the environment. The path planning algorithm works on both these levels and the subsequent coordination among AGVs is obtained exploiting shared resource (i.e., centralized information) and local negotiation (i.e., decentralized coordination). The proposed approach is validated by means of simulations and comparison using real plants.},

abstract = {Autonomous vehicles is a rapidly expanding field, and promise to play an important role in society. The goal of autonomous vehicles is to improve the traffic system in terms of higher efficiency, fewer accidents, lower fuel consumption, less pollution, and shorter travel times. In more isolated environments, such as mines and ports, vehicle automation can bring significant efficiency and production benefits and it eliminates repetitive jobs that can lead to inattention and accidents. The results of this thesis are developed within the iQMatic project, which is lead by Scania CV AB in collaboration with Saab AB, Autoliv, Link{\"{o}}ping University, and KTH, with the goal of developing a fully autonomous truck for mining applications by 2018. The thesis addresses the problem of lateral and longitudinal dynamics control of autonomous ground vehicles with the purpose of accurate and smooth path following. Clothoids are curves with linearly varying curvature, which are widely used in road design due to their smoothness properties. In the thesis, clothoids are used in the design of optimal predictive controllers aimed at minimizing the lateral forces and jerks in the vehicle. First, a clothoid-based path sparsification algorithm is proposed to efficiently describe the reference path. This approach relies on a sparseness regularization technique such that a minimal number of clothoids is used to describe the reference path. Second, a clothoid-based model predictive controller (MPCC) is proposed. This controller aims at producing a smooth driving by taking advantage of the clothoid properties. The motion of a vehicle traveling at low speeds is assumed to define a clothoid segment if the steering angle is chosen to vary piecewise linearly with respect to the traveled distance. Third, an alternative formulation of a controller for smooth driving is presented. In this case, we formulate the problem as an economic model predictive controller (EMPC). In EMPC the objective function contains an economic cost (here represented by comfort or smoothness), which is described by the second and first derivatives of the curvature. This results in that the obtained curvature is approximately linear. Fourth, the generation of feasible speed profiles, and the longitudinal vehicle control for following these, is studied. The speed profile generation is formulated as an optimization problem with two contradictory objectives: to drive as fast as possible (close to the speed limit) while accelerating as little as possible. Constraints are given by vehicle limitations and road geometry. The longitudinal controller is formulated in a similar way, but is implemented in a receding horizon fashion, and provides feasible reference speeds to a cruise controller. Finally, experimental and simulation evaluation are performed. The EMPC is deployed on a Scania construction truck. The experimental evaluation with the EMPC demonstrates its good performance, since the deviation from the path never exceeds 30 cm and in average is 6 cm. A simulation environment is developed allowing evaluation and validation of the control design before deploying it in the experimental platform. The EMPC and the MPCC are compared with a pure-pursuit controller (PPC) and a standard MPC. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of both the MPCC and the EMPC. Furthermore, the EMPC clearly outperforms the PPC in terms of path accuracy and the standard MPC in terms of driving smoothness.},

abstract = {The path taken by a car with a given minimum turning radius has a lower bound on its radius of curvature at each point, but the path has cusps if the car shifts into or out of reverse gear. What is the shortest such path a car can travel between two points if its starting and ending directions are specified? One need consider only paths with at most 2 cusps or reversals. We give a set of paths which is sufficient in the sense that it always contains a shortest path and small in the sense that there are at most 68, but usually many fewer paths in the set for any pair of endpoints and directions. We give these paths by explicit formula. Calculating the length of each of these paths and selecting the (not necessarily unique) path with smallest length yields a simple algorithm for a shortest path in each case. These optimal paths or geodesies may be described as follows: If C is an arc of a circle of the minimal turning radius and S is a line segment, then it is sufficient to consider only certain paths of the form CCSCC where arcs and segments fit smoothly, one or more of the arcs or segments may vanish, and where reversals, or equivalently cusps, between arcs or segments are allowed. This contrasts with the case when cusps are not allowed, where Dubins (1957) has shown that paths of the form CCC and CSC suffice.},

For an autonomous terrestrial vehicle, this article proposes using an optimal trajectory on a specific range as a reference in a tracking loop. In previous studies, the optimization has been made using a Genetic Algorithm (GA), and the obtained trajectory has been injected into a Potential Field (PF) so as to be reactive to unforeseen events. Here, the previously developed GA-PF method is inserted in a new global planning and tracking method for longitudinal feedback control. An optimal trajectory is used as an input reference and a tracking schema is developed using an inverted bicycle model as an efficient feedforward control, and a robust controller to take the vehicle parameter variations into account.

CC Steer also verifies a topological property that ensures that when it is used within a general motion-planning scheme, it yields a complete collision-free path planner. The coupling of CC Steer with a general planning scheme yields a path planner that computes collision-free paths verifying the properties mentioned above. Accordingly, a car-like vehicle can followsuch paths without ever having to stop in order to reorient its front wheels. Besides, such paths can be followed with a nominal speed which is proportional to the curvature derivative limit. The paths computed by CC Steer are made up of line segments, circular arcs, and clothoid arcs. They are not optimal in length. However, it is shown that they converge toward the optimal “Reeds and Shepp” paths when the curvature derivative upper bound tends to infinity. The capabilities of CC Steer to serve as an efficient steering method within two general planning schemes are also demonstrated. Index},

We discuss a method of generating clothoid-based trajectories using constructive polylines. The goal of the motion planner is to create a path for a large car-like vehicle in human driving environments, thus, the trajectories must be smooth, drivable, and natural enough to be used on roadways. We show several examples of trajectories developed for a DARPA Urban Challenge vehicle.},

@article{Gim2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. This paper addresses a continuous curvature path generation problem for car-like vehicle navigation. The continuous curvature path is generated by multiple clothoids composition and parametric adjustment. According to the geometric conditions of the given initial and final configurations, the path generation problem is classified into two cases and then, each problem is solved by by appropriate proposed algorithm. The solution is obtained by iterative procedure subject to geometric constraint as well as solution constraints. For computational efficiency and fast convergence in the proposed algorithms, a minimax sharpness constraint is proposed as the solution constraint by minimizing the maximum sharpness of the feasible solutions. After the generation of the proposed path, the resultant curvature/sharpness diagram provides a useful information about its orientation and curvature continuity along the travel length. The proposed path planning strategy, permits us to obtain online, smooth and safe path between two defined configurations while ensuring high passengers comfort (continuous curvature and transition between the different composed clothoids). The algorithmic proposals have been applied to generate continuous curvature for two cases. The first correspond to local path planning for ensuring obstacle avoidance or lane change. The second application corresponds to global path smoothing. The resultant global path path is tested on the Lyapunov-based control scheme and showed improved performance on its steering work (reduction of 41.0{\%} than the driving based on the raw data), which permits us therefore to validate the effectiveness of the obtained global path for car-like vehicles path following.},

abstract = {The current industrial state of the art for automated guided vehicles relies on centralised controllers dispatching transports to vehicles along predefined paths. The design of these paths is time-consuming and has to be done in advance, followed by an extensive testing phase. In the field of mobile robotics, robust path planning and navigation algorithms exist. However, they have not yet found their way into industrial applications in larger numbers. In this paper, we present a system architecture for a decentralised control of multiple automated guided vehicles performing material transportation tasks in intra-logistic applications which is based on mobile robotics solutions. The proposed system includes solutions for self-localisation, behaviour control, conflict-free routing and motion control. The non-centralised control of the system architecture allows for dynamic path planning and traffic coordination. Its implementation is based on the Robot Operating System, the de-facto standard middleware for robotics applications. We give an overview of the overall system architecture as well as the coordination mechanisms and show a first proof of concept in simulations.},

The complete solution is most commonly attributed to Euler in 1744 because of his compelling mathematical treatment and illustrations, but in fact James Bernoulli had arrived at the correct equation a half-century earlier. The elastica can be understood from a number of different aspects, including as a mechanical equilibrium, a problem of the calculus of variations, and the solution to elliptic integrals. In addition, it has a number of analogies with physical systems, including a sheet holding a volume of water, the surface of a capillary, and the motion of a simple pendulum. It is also the mathematical model of the mechanical spline, used for shipbuilding and similar applications, and directly insipired the modern theory of mathematical splines. More recently, the major focus has been on efficient numerical techniques for computing the elastica and fitting it to spline problems. All in all, it is a beautiful family of curves based on beautiful mathematics and a rich and fascinating history. This report is adapted from a Ph. D. thesis done under the direction of Prof. C. H. S´equin.},

Yet challenges remain regarding guaranteed performance and safety under all driving circumstances. For instance, planning methods that provide safe and system-compliant performance in complex, cluttered environments while modeling the uncertain interaction with other traffic participants are required. Furthermore , new paradigms, such as interactive planning and end-to-end learning, open up questions regarding safety and reliability that need to be addressed. In this survey, we emphasize recent approaches for integrated perception and planning and for behavior-aware planning, many of which rely on machine learning. This raises the question of verification and safety, which we also touch upon. Finally, we discuss the state of the art and remaining challenges for managing fleets of autonomous vehicles.},

abstract = {We present an approach to the problem of differentially constrained mobile robot motion planning in arbitrary cost fields. The approach is based on deterministic search in a specially discretized state space. We compute a set of elementary motions that connects each discrete state value to a set of its reachable neighbors via feasible motions. Thus, this set of motions induces a connected search graph. The motions are carefully designed to terminate at discrete states, whose dimensions include relevant state variables (e.g., position, heading, curvature, and velocity). The discrete states, and thus the motions, repeat at regular intervals, forming a lattice. We ensure that all paths in the graph encode feasible motions via the imposition of continuity constraints on state variables at graph vertices and compliance of the graph edges with a differential equation comprising the vehicle model. The resulting state lattice permits fast full configuration space cost evaluation and collision detection. Experimental results with research prototype rovers demonstrate that the planner allows us to exploit the entire envelope of vehicle maneuverability in rough terrain, while featuring real-time performance.},

We formulate the problem as an MDP with action-dependent stochasticity and propose an approximate online solution to it. We use a trajectory optimizer with a deterministic model to suggest promising actions to the MDP, to reduce computation time spent on evaluating different actions. We conducted experiments in simulation and on a real robotic system. Our results show that with a task-adaptive planning and control approach, a robot can choose fast or slow actions depending on the task accuracy and uncertainty level. The robot makes these decisions online and is able to maintain high success rates while completing manipulation tasks as fast as possible.},

abstract = {Autonomous vehicles is a rapidly expanding eld and the need for robust and efficient path planners is high. We approach the global pathplanning problem for an autonomous load carrier for quarry environments, developed at Volvo Construction Equipment, using two methods: a twostep path planning and path smoothing approach, and a method based on an optimal control formulation of the path planning problem. The two-step method is based on smoothing an initial path found by A*, an efficient grid search algorithm, by fitting a curve consisting of as few clothoid segments as possible to the A* path. The smoothing is done by rewriting the non-linear optimization problem to a convex form by a linearization of the deviation constraints around the curvature of the A* path. An iterative method is then used to relax the `0-norm, which measures the number of non-zero elements in a vector, with a weighted `1-norm which, in turn, is then solved efficiently using CVX in Matlab. The optimal control based path planning method solves the nonlinear optimization problem using IPOPT. It was found that the completeness of the A* algorithm, coupled with the guaranteed solution of a convex problem, resulted in a very robust method that was able to nd paths through mazes and difficult situations. The optimal control approach produced better paths, but had a tendency to sometimes show inconsistent behavior.},

@article{Dresner2008,
abstract = {Artificial intelligence research is ushering in a new era of sophisticated, mass-market transportation technology. While computers can already fly a passenger jet better than a trained human pilot, people are still faced with the dangerous yet tedious task of driving automobiles. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is the field that focuses on integrating information technology with vehicles and transportation infrastructure to make transportation safer, cheaper, and more efficient. Recent advances in ITS point to a future in which vehicles themselves handle the vast majority of the driving task. Once autonomous vehicles become popular, autonomous interactions amongst multiple vehicles will be possible. Current methods of vehicle coordination, which are all designed to work with human drivers, will be outdated. The bottleneck for roadway efficiency will no longer be the drivers, but rather the mechanism by which those drivers' actions are coordinated. While open-road driving is a well-studied and more-or-less-solved problem, urban traffic scenarios, especially intersections, are much more challenging. We believe current methods for controlling traffic, specifically at intersections, will not be able to take advantage of the increased sensitivity and precision of autonomous vehicles as compared to human drivers. In this article, we suggest an alternative mechanism for coordinating the movement of autonomous vehicles through intersections. Drivers and intersections in this mechanism are treated as autonomous agents in a multiagent system. In this multiagent system, intersections use a new reservation-based approach built around a detailed communication protocol, which we also present. We demonstrate in simulation that our new mechanism has the potential to significantly outperform current intersection control technology—traffic lights and stop signs. Because our mechanism can emulate a traffic light or stop sign, it subsumes the most popular current methods of intersection control. This article also presents two extensions to the mechanism. The first extension allows the system to control human-driven vehicles in addition to autonomous vehicles. The second gives priority to emergency vehicles without significant cost to civilian vehicles. The mechanism, including both extensions, is implemented and tested in simulation, and we present experimental results that strongly attest to the efficacy of this approach.},
